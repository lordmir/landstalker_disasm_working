{5B}There is a rumor that{57}Gumi is possessed{57}by an evil spirit.{5E}
{5B}I'm all right.{57}Get those monsters first!!{5E}
{5B}Oh, Nigel...sigh...{57}You looked so brave{57}fighting the Orc Kings...{62}
{5B}If only my father's{57}red jewel were our dowry!{5E}
{5B}Somebody's gotta put{57}those Gumi savages in their{57}place!  If only I were younger....{5E}
{5B}That's it!  That's the last{57}straw!!  I'll do it!!{5E}
{5B}They took Fara{57}into the shrine.{57}We tried to go in, but....{62}
{5B}the door wouldn't open.{5E}
{5B}I can see now that I was{57}wrong....the tribesmen of{57}Gumi are our brothers.{5E}
{5B}Be careful what you say....{57}my husband is enraged!{5E}
{5B}My husband and son{57}stormed out of the room....{62}
{5B}I'm so worried!{5E}
{5B}Thank you, Nigel.{57}Now that Massan and Gumi{57}are friends once more,{62}
{5B}peace and harmony will be{57}restored to our village!{5E}
{5B}Have you met anyone who{57}looks different from us?{58}
{5B}Oh, yeah?{5E}
{5B}Well, be warned!{62}
{5B}They're Gumi tribesmen,{57}and they don't like us{57}in Massan.{62}
{5B}Don't go south...you'll{57}get a raw deal!{5E}
{5B}I may be just a kid,{57}but I'm courageous enough{57}to go and beat them!{5E}
{5B}....sob!...sob!....{57}I'm so scared...!  Papa{57}followed them to the shrine...{5E}
{5B}Doesn't Mom look happy, now?{5E}
{5B}"Plant the seeds and{57}watch them GROW!{62}
{5B}Soon you'll reap what{57}you have SOWN!{62}

{5B}They used something strange{57}to open that door...{5E}
{5B}Listen, Nigel!  I wrote a{57}new song.  It's called{57}THREE GUYS FROM MASSAN:{62}
{5B}"Three guys bravely go, go,{57}GO!  Three guys boldly.....{57}nice song, huh?{5E}
{5B}Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da{57}GROW!  Soon you'll reap{57}ba-dee-da-DO!{62}
{5B}Oh!  It's you, Nigel!{62}
{5B}Thanks for your help the other{57}day.  Why don't you buy{57}{5F} directly from the farm!{5E}
{5B}I heard it through the{57}EkeEke vine that Gumi warriors{57}are often seen around the{62}
{5B}bridge these days...at least,{57}that's what they say.....{5E}
{5B}He...he rushed out of here{57}with the guy next door.{57}He was really enraged!!{5E}
{5B}Hi, Nigel and Friday!{57}How have you been?{5E}
{5B}I've lived here since I was a{57}child...Massan and Gumi were{57}very good friends long ago.{62}
{5B}What started the feud?{57}Nobody really...{59}I know!{62}
{5B}Go see the Old Man{57}at the Waterfall Shrine.{57}Maybe he can tell you!{5E}
{5B}It must be an evil curse!{57}Evil haunts us all...{5E}
{5B}At last, Massan and Gumi{57}will attain their former{57}greatness as sister villages!{5E}
{5B}You must go see the{57}Waterfall Shrine Sage.{62}
{5B}Careful, though...he's{57}eccentric!{5E}
{5B}Brrrrr...{59}...{59}scary!{5E}
{5B}Sob!.....sob!...{57}Is Fara c-coming back?....{5E}
{5B}You did it!  Do you know{57}the saying "DON'T JUDGE A{57}DAHL BY ITS COLOR"?{5E}
{5B}You're a treasure hunter,{57}aren'tcha?{62}
{5B}Ha, don't even{57}try to hide it!{57}I sensed it at once!{62}
{5B}Have you met the sage{57}at the Waterfall Shrine?{58}
{5B}Oh, really?  Huh!{57}So you're a thief AND a liar!{5E}
{5B}Ha, ha, ha!{57}You need more experience, kid!{5E}
{5B}Good heavens!  Nice to{57}meet you again, young boy!{62}
{5B}Oh, the landslide?{57}Yes, well...we seem to have{57}run out of luck!{62}
{5B}The village was empty, so{57}I searched for some valuables,{57}but there was nothing to take.{62}
{5B}All I found was{57}some old statue at the{57}mayor's house.{62}
{5B}There were also some{57}golds lying around,{57}but of course I didn't{62}
{5B}touch them...{59}...{59}NOT!!!{5E}
{5B}You can't blame me,{57}can you?{62}
{5B}I know you're the same.{57}You're a thief, too. Ha, ha!{5E}
{5B}We have to move this{57}debris to get to Mercator.{5E}
{5B}You again!{62}
{5B}Me?  Ah, I came here{57}in search of the treasures,{57}but grew sleepy....{62}
{5B}They say the trees{57}can be a treasure hunter's{57}best friend...{62}
{5B}I wonder{57}what that means?.....{5E}
{5B}What a coincidence!{57}How are things going?{57}Me?  Hmmm...so-so!{5E}
{5B}Hey, young man!{57}It's me!{62}
{5B}Oh, woe is me!{57}I was caught in a strange{57}trap, and...here I am.{62}
{5B}Well, I've been put in{57}many a jail in my time,{57}but never one that{62}
{5B}stank like this!{57}I can't stand it!!{5E}
{5B}We have many suspicious{57}guests these days...oh!{57}You ARE a guest here!{5E}
{5B}That strange man flew off{57}like the wind.....{5E}
{5B}You're that hero-boy,{57}aren't you?  Well, any friend{57}of Fara's.....{5E}
{5B}Is...is Miss Friday all right?{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  Friday!  Fara needs{57}our help....but I'm{57}too scared to move!!{5E}
{5B}Friday!  Am I ever glad{57}to see you!{5E}
{5B}I look forward to{57}seeing you again, Friday{57}Oh, and you, too, Nigel...{5E}
{5B}On the west side of Gumi,{57}the road branches off into{57}two paths at the sea.{62}
{5B}The right path leads to the{57}big town, Mercator.{62}
{5B}The left leads to Ryuma,{57}which is famous for its{57}lighthouse.{5E}
{5B}They will sacrifice Fara{57}to their evil gods!{57}Won't you help?{5E}
{5B}Gumi is the village{57}just south of us.  They're{57}an atrocious tribe.{5E}
{5B}I have to stay here and{57}defend this village.{57}It's my responsibility.{5E}
{5B}Remember, Nigel...{57}the straightest path has{57}many curves.{5E}
{5B}Hi!  I can give you a{57}helpful hint about a{57}specialty of this island.{62}
{5B}Do you know about it?{58}
{5B}You do?  Oh.{5E}
{5B}It's a restorative called{57}EkeEke.  It contains a megadose{57}of the Ekenol vitamin.{62}
{5B}You can buy it anywhere.{57}Got it?{5E}
{5B}Fara was kidnapped because{57}she's the cutest among us.{57}Oh, my goodness!{62}
{5B}That means I'm next!{57}What should I do!{5E}
{5B}I heard about your exploits!{57}I know, I know.  It's all{57}thanks to EkeEke, right?{5E}
{5B}Arf, arf!{5E}
{5B}Oh!  You can understand me?{57}I'm a girl, or...well,{57}at least I was until{62}
{5B}Helga, a witch in the{57}woods east of Mercator,{57}changed me into a dog.{62}
{5B}Marty, my sweetheart, is{57}also under her spell.  She's{57}made him into her pet!{62}
{5B}Oh, how my heart longs to{57}see him...sigh.....but I{57}can't.  Helga told us{62}
{5B}we can never return to our{57}human forms if we meet{57}each other in these figures...{62}
{5B}The curse on us will never{57}be lifted unless Helga{57}dies....howoooo!....{5E}
{5B}Thank you, thank you!{57}Marty and I will make this{57}house our home, now.{5E}
{5B}I really....yarf!  Arf arf!{62}
{5B}Oh, no!  What's happening?{57}Marty and I are{57}changing back again...{62}
{5B}Ha, ha, ha!  Just kidding!{57}Good luck!{5E}
{5B}Cock-cock-a-cock{5E}
{5B}Cock-co-co-cock{5E}
{5B}If you see something{57}you want, bring it to the{57}counter and set it down.{5E}
{5B}It's my duty to make{57}records and perform healings.{57}What do you want?{62}
{5B}Bring any book to me.{5E}
{5B}Is there really a goddess?{5E}
{5B}If there really is a{57}goddess, why did she let them{57}take Fara?....boo-hoo-hoo!....{5E}
{5B}Now I know there's a goddess!{5E}
{5B}Take the note and{57}put it on the counter{57}if you want to stay.{5E}
{5B}Ooooo!  I'm so angry!{57}Wait'll the mayor hears{57}about THIS!!{5E}
{5B}I've never met such a{57}courageous man.{57}I really respect you!{5E}
{5B}I'm still studying{57}the old documents.{57}Could you give me more time?{5E}
{5B}Is it true that Fara{57}has been kidnapped?{57}Unbelievable...{62}
{5B}I think the Gumi tribe is{57}controlled by the Orcs!{57}Fara must be in danger...{62}
{5B}Go to the Marsh Shrine{57}and save Fara.{57}Please hurry, Nigel!{5E}
{5B}Good, good...{57}The two tribes will get close{57}to each other from now on.{62}
{5B}About King Nole...I just{57}found out that he did exist{57}in very ancient times.{62}
{5B}That's all I can find{57}in my books.  Hopefully, you can{57}find out more in Mercator.....{5E}
{5B}Hmm, lithograph, eh?...{57}The jewels must belong{57}to King Nole.{62}
{5B}According to my records,{57}there are five jewels in all.{57}If the jewels are real.....{62}
{5B}Interesting...{57}Come see me again.{5E}
{5B}Mercator is a big town.{57}You'll have fun there, but...{57}beware of the duke!!...{5E}
{5B}What?  You're going off{57}to defeat Lord Mir?  Hmmmm...{57}Well, if you must, but....{62}
{5B}I still believe he's innocent.{5E}
{5B}Oh, you actually saw{57}Lord Mir?  Is he all right?...{57}Great!{62}
{5B}You can fully trust him.{57}Believe whatever he tells you!{5E}
{5B}So, the duke finally{57}broke his cover...now everyone{57}will know he's looking for the{62}
{5B}treasures of King Nole.{62}
{5B}Perhaps your coming{57}here convinced him there was{57}some truth to the legends{62}
{5B}after all.....{5E}
{5B}He has abandoned{57}the town.{62}
{5B}He would do{57}anything to find the{57}legendary treasures.{62}
{5B}Nigel!  Don't let him get{57}the treasures!  You must{57}stop his foul ambition!{62}
{5B}If the duke finds those{57}treasures.....it'll be the{57}end of the world!{5E}
{5B}Who are you?{57}Get out of here, stranger!{5E}
{5B}W-we're sorry.{5E}
{5B}Sorry.{57}Sacred rite.{57}No visitors allowed!{5E}
{5B}Welcome to the{57}village of Gumi.{5E}
{5B}Did you know that we were{57}controlled by the monsters{57}they call the Orc Kings?{62}
{5B}Actually, I don't remember{57}a thing.{5E}
{5B}I'm ashamed of myself...{57}We let the monsters control{57}us and profane our most{62}
{5B}sacred shrine.  I want to{57}apologize to Massan, too.{57}Will they ever forgive us?{5E}
{5B}We're going to cooperate{57}with Massan from now on.{5E}
{5B}Thank you!  Thanks.{5E}
{5B}Don't be too hard on us.{57}We're really very sorry.....{5E}
{5B}Get out of here!{57}Get out!{5E}
{5B}Was I rude before?  Sorry...{57}Remember--you'll get ahead{57}if you put others first.{5E}
{5B}They say a witch lives{57}near Mercator.  I hear she's{57}very old.{5E}
{5B}Go away!{5E}
{5B}Mercator?{57}Exit this village and{57}head west.{5E}
{5B}I can't go to Mercator{57}because of the landslide.{5E}
{5B}The road to Mercator{57}is open at last!{5E}
{5B}Just a minute!{57}We're the emergency repair{57}experts.  This'll only take{62}
{5B}a second...{5E}
{5B}I'm too tired to speak.{57}...Oh, yes, of course!{57}You can go through, now.{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!{5E}
{5B}I like all the folks{57}in this village.  Bow-wow!{5E}
{5B}Coooooock...cock...{5E}
{5B}I couldn't go to the{57}shrine with them...{5E}
{5B}Is it true that you are{57}unbelievably strong?{62}
{5B}In that case, stay as{57}long as you like.{5E}
{5B}It's hard to inspire{57}others to good deeds when{57}so many evils beset us.....{5E}
{5B}They were possessed?...{57}Oh, my goodness!{5E}
{5B}We had a big earthquake{57}a few days ago.{57}Natural disasters seem almost{62}
{5B}commonplace nowadays....{5E}
{5B}Ahhh...that was refreshing!{57}Have a nice trip!{5E}
{5B}Hi, this is Ryuma.{5E}
{5B}Isn't there a hero{57}somewhere who can{57}help us...?{5E}
{5B}They say you're a{57}hero, young man!{5E}
{5B}I saw some blond beauty{57}leaving town with{57}two laughing monsters.....{5E}
{5B}We suffer many calamities{57}these days.  The lighthouse{57}was vandalized this time.{5E}
{5B}I bet I could run those{57}thieves out of town{59}.{59}.{59}.{57}if I were older.{5E}
{5B}Father...{5E}
{5B}Why did you go{57}without me?{5E}
{5B}I know you can get the{57}{5F}, 'cuz I'm going{57}with you this time!{5E}
{5B}Ryuma is an old town.{62}
{5B}Believe it or not, this town{57}was much bigger than Mercator{57}a long, long time ago.{5E}
{5B}I heard that Mercator is{57}governed by Duke Mercator now.{5E}
{5B}Was Duke Mercator{57}really such a rogue?{5E}
{5B}You came here to look{57}for the treasures, too?{62}
{5B}If it's true,{57}I want to have a share.{5E}
{5B}Don't forget to give me{57}a share when you find{57}the treasures!  Ho, ho!{5E}
{5B}Sales are off this{57}month because of the thieves!{5E}
{5B}Leave this place and{57}go back to your home!!{62}
{5B}You won't regret taking{57}my advice.....{5E}
{5B}Thank you, Nigel.{57}You're the town's very own{57}saviour!{5E}
{5B}Hello, Nigel.{57}Seems we just have one{57}problem after another.{62}
{5B}Have you seen the{57}lighthouse yet?  Nobody can{57}reach us without the light.{5E}
{5B}Lately, this is a{57}dangerous place!  A gang of{57}thieves has come to this town.{5E}
{5B}I'm packin' my bags!{57}Who wants to live with{57}thieves?{5E}
{5B}Now that the thieves are{57}gone, I think I'll stay here{57}for a while....'Bye now!{5E}
{5B}Oh, are you a visitor?{57}We get so few these days{57}thanks to the thieves.{5E}
{5B}Horrible!!...{5E}
{5B}I look forward to{57}seeing you again.{57}No, really...I mean it!{5E}
{5B}The {5F} was stolen{57}by the apprentice of{57}the lighthouse keeper!{62}
{5B}Did you know?{5E}
{5B}The shop owner has gone.{57}Where am I supposed to get{57}herbs and such now?{5E}
{5B}They're thieves, but{57}they are still human beings.{57}I must convert them!{5E}
{5B}They must be devils!!...{5E}
{5B}Were they monsters?{57}Really?{5E}
{5B}People are unhappy now.{57}But I'm sure they'll{57}find happiness someday.{5E}
{5B}We live in fear of the{57}thieves who infest the cave{57}on the promontory.{5E}
{5B}Please save our town...{5E}
{5B}You defeated the{57}thieves all by yourself?{57}Unbelievable!!{5E}
{5B}Please restore the light{57}to our lighthouse soon!!{5E}
{5B}You've been most helpful{57}to this town.{5E}
{5B}They're quick to take flight.{57}Chickens!!{62}
{5B}Mercator soldiers drove them{57}back to the promontory,{57}but they escaped.{5E}
{5B}Won't someone please make{57}those thieves go away?!{5E}
{5B}You're great!{57}How did you ever brave the{57}depths of that cave alone?{5E}
{5B}To get the {5F} is{57}almost impossible!  Tell me{57}who can do it!{5E}
{5B}What!{57}You found the {5F}!{57}Incredible!{5E}
{5B}I thank you from the{57}bottom of my heart!  When you{57}find the treasures.....{62}
{5B}please buy every item{57}in the shop!  Ha ha ha ha!{62}
{5B}Sorry...just a little{57}salesman humor!{5E}
{5B}The people of Mercator{57}are also troubled by this{57}business with the lighthouse,{62}
{5B}aren't they?{57}They're saying the Duke{57}has gone off somewhere...{62}
{5B}Do you think he{57}went to find a{57}Sun Stone, too?{5E}
{5B}...mumble...{57}my son is out now...{5E}
{5B}...mumble...{57}please avenge my son!{57}...please...!{5E}
{5B}...mumble...mumble...{5E}
{5B}...mumble...I wonder{57}if she's okay...{57}over in Mercator...{62}
{5B}...is her husband still...{57}collecting jars?...mumble...{5E}
{5B}My dad is out right now.{57}He said he's gotta{57}do something important.{5E}
{5B}Father always told me...{57}..that seamen never cry...{57}....choke!...sob...{5E}
{5B}Ha ha!!  Papa came back!{57}He's very strong, isn't he?{5E}
{5B}Don't blame my dad!{62}
{5B}He was more shocked than{57}anybody when that apprentice{57}guy stole the Sun Stone.{5E}
{5B}You're way cool!{57}Next to my dad, you're{57}the greatest!{5E}
{5B}Nigel, good timing!  My{57}apprentice has disappeared{57}in all this confusion.{62}
{5B}Why don't you work here{57}in his place?{58}
{5B}Hahahahaha!{57}Just kidding!  What a{57}good-natured boy you are!{5E}
{5B}That's okay!  The people of{57}Ryuma need your help more{57}than I do.  You're a good boy!{5E}
{5B}My runaway assistant{57}came back suddenly...{62}
{5B}and took off with{57}the {5F}....{5E}
{5B}The master isn't here now,{57}but maybe I can explain{57}how it works.{62}
{5B}This lighthouse uses a{57}Sun Stone, the brightest stone{57}in all the land, to guide ships{62}
{5B}safely to the harbor.{5E}
{5B}M-my...master was{57}killed by the thieves...{57}What should I do???{5E}
{5B}Owwwwww....I'm sorry!...{57}l wouldn'ta done it if I knew{57}it was part of the duke's plot!{5E}
{5B}Owwwoooo.....!!!{57}Please let me go...{57}I'm really sorry...{5E}
{5B}I'm a new person now!{57}I'll work hard under Arthur{57}to right my wicked ways!{5E}
{5B}The thieves must be{57}looking for the same{57}treasures you are.{62}
{5B}There must be a clue{57}somewhere in the cave!{5E}
{5B}You found the lithograph there?{57}Great!  It must be a clue!{57}Let me see it!{62}
{5B}What?!{57}It was snatched away?{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator abandoned his{57}town for the treasures...{62}
{5B}I guess that means{57}the legendary treasures{57}really exist!{5E}
{5B}Would you mind going out now?{57}We're in a meeting.{5E}
{5B}So you heard us...{57}Well, the mayor went to try to{57}bargain with the thieves...{62}
{5B}but he never came back.{57}What happened?{5E}
{5B}You saved the town!{57}I can't believe you did it{57}alone!{5E}
{5B}Greenmaze is also known{57}as the "Forest of the Lost."{62}
{5B}It is said that once you{57}step into the woods...{59}...{57}you never come back out.{62}
{5B}It's so dangerous that{57}Duke Mercator forbids us{57}to go in.{5E}
{5B}The mayor is out...{5E}
{5B}It's all over for this town{57}if the mayor is killed...{5E}
{5B}It's unanimous!  You're the{57}honorary citizen of Ryuma!{5E}
{5B}What will you do{57}with the treasures?{5E}
{5B}Oh, it's our honorary citizen!{57}We're having a meeting{57}to decide who's going{62}
{5B}to get the {5F}.{5E}
{5B}Go take a look around town,{57}young man!{5E}
{5B}Young man, you've caught us{57}at a bad time.  I don't know{57}how to put this, but....{62}
{5B}we've got a problem.{57}Would you do us a favor?{58}
{5B}Quick response!{57}Are you sure?{57}OK!{62}
{5B}Their hideout is in{57}the cave on the promontory.{57}You can get there by raft.{5E}
{5B}You're right,  I should tell you{57}what I want first.{57}I want you to go to their{62}
{5B}hideout and wipe them out.{57}Will you do it?{58}
{5B}I'm disappointed in you,{57}boy...{5E}
{5B}I knew you were really{57}something all along!{5E}
{5B}It's quite difficult, but...{57}if anyone can solve Greenmaze,{57}it's you, Nigel.{62}
{5B}To get to the Sun Stone,{57}you'll need a good sense of{57}balance and excellent{62}
{5B}jumping skills.{5E}
{5B}Aren't you afraid of{57}thieves?  Go home!{5E}
{5B}I'm hiding 'cause{57}I'm afraid of the thieves.{5E}
{5B}I'm still frightened...{57}Are they gone yet?{5E}
{5B}Another betrayal!{57}I can't trust anyone anymore!{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!{5E}
{5B}Hmmmmm...I live here because{57}I love the tang of the sea.{5E}
{5B}You can get into Mercator{57}with the {5F}.{5E}
{5B}I think we need{57}an exorcism or something.{5E}
{5B}It's strange...{57}Where is the mayor?{57}What's happening to this town?{5E}
{5B}What on earth{57}do those thieves want?{5E}
{5B}A strange blond woman just{57}snatched my safe-conduct pass!{5E}
{5B}If ya ain't got a{57}safe-conduct pass, ya ain't{57}gettin' in these gates!{5E}
{5B}This is Mercator, where{57}money's the most important{57}thing in the world!{5E}
{5B}Heheheh....{57}Sorry 'bout that.  I'll make{57}it up to you someday.{5E}
{5B}My legs are sore from{57}standing here all day long.{5E}
{5B}Mercator is a historic town.{57}We welcome you.{5E}
{5B}Hello, Nigel!{57}How you doing?{5E}
{5B}Mercator is a{57}beautiful town, great for{57}sightseeing and entertainment.{5E}
{5B}I've just arrived from the{57}continent.  Gosh, what{57}a big town!{5E}
{5B}I heard that Madame{57}Yard's is a great place to{57}rid oneself of stress!{5E}
{5B}Wowie!!  Mercator is{57}wonderful!  I LIKE it!{57}I want to stay here forever!{5E}
{5B}The prices are way too high{57}in this town.  I'm gonna need{57}a lot more money...{5E}
{5B}You're new in town, right?{5E}
{5B}I spent all my money!{57}I have to go home, but I can't{57}afford the trip back!{5E}
{5B}This young fool was the{57}lighthouse keeper's assistant.{57}His master fully trusted him,{62}
{5B}but he stole the {5F}!{57}He betrayed his master!{5E}
{5B}Young men nowadays lack{57}grit!  They are always taking{57}the short view of things!{5E}
{5B}We are discussing{57}the future of Mercator.{5E}
{5B}I can't believe it!  I spent{57}over 1000 golds on that{57}stupid chicken race!!{5E}
{5B}We almost never get to{57}go inside the castle...{5E}
{5B}The duke is now receiving{57}applications for mercenaries.{5E}
{5B}YOU were invited to the{57}castle?  You must be strong!{57}Can I have your autograph?{5E}
{5B}No, no, don't disturb me!{57}This requires my utmost{57}concentration...{5E}
{5B}What's wrong with you?{57}Go ahead!  Just open the{57}door and go in!{5E}
{5B}How was it?  Not quite{57}what you thought, was it?{5E}
{5B}I said, do not disturb me!{57}Hammana, hammena, hammina...{5E}
{5B}The {5F}!{57}I can see it!{57}Now go and get it!{62}
{5B}Then the lighthouse{57}will be restored!{62}
{5B}I think you're smart{57}enough to get through{57}Greenmaze on your own.{5E}
{5B}You got the {5F}!{57}My crystal ball never lies....{5E}
{5B}Please don't disturb{57}me, or I will be forced to{57}turn you into a dog!!{62}
{5B}Now, where was I?.....{5E}
{5B}I want to be young again.....{5E}
{5B}Hi, cutie!{57}Am I pretty?{57}Am I young? La-la-la!{5E}
{5B}If my mom really becomes{57}young, I can boast to all my{57}friends!{5E}
{5B}I'm happy to see my mom{57}young again, but...{5E}
{5B}Monsters on this island{57}are rare.  They fetch a{57}good price on the continent.{5E}
{5B}I got a ton of golds for{57}the monsters!  I'm going to{57}Greenpea's Playhouse.{5E}
{5B}I caught the three most{57}wanted criminals on this{57}island!  They'll bring in{62}
{5B}a good price!{5E}
{5B}...grrrrrrrrr...{5E}
{5B}....whoooOOOOoooo!!!......{5E}
{5B}YAAARRRG!!.....{5E}
{5B}Hissssss!!!.....{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is a man of{57}fine character.  This{57}comfortable life we lead{62}
{5B}is all because of him.{57}Hurrah for Duke Mercator!{5E}
{5B}W-wh-what?{57}Duke Mercator deserted us?{57}I don't believe it!{5E}
{5B}Hurrah for General Arthur!{5E}
{5B}I heard that an evil magician{57}to the south of us is a source{57}of great distress to the Duke.{62}
{5B}He must be using his magic{57}powers to threaten the Duke{57}into giving him money.{62}
{5B}That's why we have to{57}pay a heavy tax...isn't it?{5E}
{5B}Did you defeat Mir?  Really?{57}Then why the long face?{5E}
{5B}Where will we be{57}without Duke Mercator?{5E}
{5B}General Arthur lowered{57}the tax rate.{57}He's quite a guy!{5E}
{5B}Welcome to Mr. Ludwig's.{57}If you came for a{57}music lesson,{62}
{5B}Mr. Ludwig is out.....{5E}
{5B}Ludwig is not here!{57}I'm afraid It'll be some time{57}before he returns.{5E}
{5B}Did you come here to listen{57}to him play, too?  I came{57}all the way from the continent{62}
{5B}just to hear our very own{57}national treasure play...{57}where is he?{5E}
{5B}What a pity!  I was looking{57}forward to listening to that{57}beautiful sound of his.{5E}
{5B}I'm going back to the{57}continent.  There's no sense{57}in waiting any longer{62}
{5B}for this Ludwig character.{57}What?  The lighthouse is{57}out of order?{62}
{5B}Gee!{57}Of all the rotten luck!!!{5E}
{5B}I'm going back home.{57}Looks like I'll never get to{57}hear him play, now.{5E}
{5B}Hurry, hurry!!{57}Step right up!{57}We're almost out of stock!{5E}
{5B}There's none cheaper!{57}Low-price guarantee...{57}...every day!!{5E}
{5B}This shop is famous{57}even on the continent.  I have{57}a huge shopping list for{62}
{5B}all my friends.....{5E}
{5B}This shop is always crowded{57}because it's cheaper than{57}that other shop over there.{5E}
{5B}What a fool!{57}I bought too many!{5E}
{5B}If you're not a registered{57}member, don't waste my time.{57}Scram!  Beat it!!{5E}
{5B}You again!{57}I said members only!{57}Now, out!  Out!{5E}
{5B}Please...go on upstairs.{5E}
{5B}What a stubborn kid!{57}Do you want to make me angry?{57}Get out of here!{5E}
{5B}You're too young for{57}Madame Yard's.  I'm sorry.{62}
{5B}Please come again{57}when you've grown up.{5E}
{5B}Curious boy!{57}You know, curiosity is a{57}necessity for greatness.....{5E}
{5B}Hello, kind sir.  To become{57}a member at Madame Yard's,{57}please ask at the counter.{5E}
{5B}Say hello to Miss Shorty--{57}er, I mean, Miss Friday!{5E}
{5B}Non-members can't{57}go upstairs.  Sorry.{5E}
{5B}OK, listen carefully.{57}This is a popular trick{57}among the young boys...{62}
{5B}Go and see the Fortuneteller.{57}I'm sure you'll be{57}pleasantly surprised!{5E}
{5B}Welcome to Madame Yard's!{57}She's the very best!!{5E}
{5B}Hardships are essential{57}for you to mature.{62}
{5B}There really are no{57}easy solutions.....{5E}
{5B}Quite expensive, but I feel{57}much better!  I've got to go{57}home now and...{62}
{5B}practice what I learned...{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator asked him{57}to steal the {5F} for{57}six golds!  Six!!{5E}
{5B}I've just about dislocated{57}my jaw from talking so much.{5E}
{5B}I want them to lower{57}our taxes!{5E}
{5B}My favorite game is{57}roulette!  Let's go win{57}a bundle on it!{5E}
{5B}Me?  Yes, I'm a{57}member, but I don't wear{57}my tutu when I'm off.{5E}
{5B}I've been waiting all week{57}for a session with{57}Madame Yard!{62}
{5B}If only I could afford to{57}come here more often.....{5E}
{5B}...sigh....The shop is{57}closed now.  But you can{57}see that.....{62}
{5B}As you know, there's another{57}shop just across the way.{57}Both of us sell{62}
{5B}the same items, but they{57}sell them much cheaper.{57}I'm thinking of changing{62}
{5B}my job, but I don't know what{57}kind of shop I'd be most{57}suitable for.....{62}
{5B}I don't even want to{57}get out of bed, I'm{57}such a failure!.....{5E}
{5B}I want to open a new shop...{57}...sigh...what should I do?...{5E}
{5B}Nigel, how have you been?{57}I've been thinking hard about{57}starting over,{62}
{5B}making a new life....and I{57}finally made up my mind{57}to change my job!{62}
{5B}Would you give me{57}your opinion?{58}
{5B}Yeah, I know that you're{57}busy.  Visit me later when{57}you have nothing better to do.{5E}
{5B}How about a drugstore?{58}
{5B}Hmmm....okay, then,{57}how about a variety shop?{58}
{5B}Well, I've got the list of{57}possibilities narrowed down{57}to these two.  So......{62}
{5B}choose between the two.{57}I'll follow your advice.{62}
{5B}Now, let's try once more.{62}
{5B}You agree?  Great!!{57}It looks like I'm a drugstore{57}owner from now on!{62}
{5B}You agree?  Then it's{57}settled!  I'm a variety shop{57}owner from now on!{62}
{5B}By the way, would you{57}do me a favor?{57}I'd like you to go to the{62}
{5B}wholesale market at the{57}Mercator port warehouse.{57}It opens when the ship from{62}
{5B}the continent docks here.{57}Please go to the market and{57}pick up the goods for me.{62}
{5B}I'll stay here and fix things{57}up.  Bring this with you.{57}It's a Buyers' Guild card.{62}
{5B}Did you go to the market?{5E}
{5B}I received the goods, and I'm{57}doing quite well these days!{62}
{5B}I'm happy with my new{57}shop!  This is the turning{57}point of my life!{62}
{5B}I owe it all to you, Nigel!{62}
{5B}In return, I'd like to offer you{57}my bargain basement prices!{62}
{5B}Drop by anytime!{5E}
{5B}We have a large stock{57}of unusual things!{5E}
{5B}Was the market already{57}closed?  That's okay.{57}They'll open it up again.{62}
{5B}I'll just stay here and{57}get things ready so I can{57}go for myself next month.{5E}
{5B}Dad should have checked{57}around town before{57}opening this shop...{5E}
{5B}My dad is thinking of{57}changing his job.{5E}
{5B}I'm a drugstore owner's son{57}from now on!  Wow!{5E}
{5B}I'm a variety shop owner's{57}son from now on! Wow!{5E}
{5B}My dad is a great shopkeeper.{57}I love him.{5E}
{5B}How do you do?  I'm June,{57}Fahl's fair girlfriend.{5E}
{5B}It's quite embarrassing!  My son{57}goes to Madame.....Lard's{57}or something almost everyday!{62}
{5B}I just can't understand him!{57}Is it such a great place?{5E}
{5B}Mir lives in that old tower,{57}but I hear he was in town{57}long before the duke.{62}
{5B}Apparently, the duke expelled{57}him from Mercator because of{57}some hideous crime.....{5E}
{5B}Mir lives in that old tower,{57}but I hear he was in town{57}long before the duke.{62}
{5B}Apparently, the duke expelled him{57}frome Mercator because of{57}some hideous crime.....{62}
{5B}Oh, I don't know if it's{57}true or not.  I just{57}heard it from a friend.{62}
{5B}The {5F} is a{57}precious ore.  It's only found{57}in the depths of Greenmaze.{5E}
{5B}I haven't heard a thing{58}rom my relatives in Verla{57}for a while, now.....{5E}
{5B}I heard that Duke Mercator{57}brought nothing but trouble{57}to Verla as well.{5E}
{5B}If General Arthur had been{57}killed, Mercator would be{57}a ghost town, now!{5E}
{5B}I disagree with him.{57}I think Madame Yard's{57}is a nice place.{5E}
{5B}It's impossible to enter{57}Mir's tower because of{57}the barrier at the door...{5E}
{5B}...Oh, it's you...{5E}
{5B}Greenmaze is to the north{57}of the castle.  Many tourists{57}are reported missing there{62}
{5B}each year, so the duke{57}prohibited all entry{57}into Greenmaze.{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is crazy with{57}greed over those treasures.{57}Are they really so valuable?{5E}
{5B}I'm quite satisfied with{57}General Arthur's{57}administration.{5E}
{5B}I saw a great beauty{57}walking along the street.{57}Her two attendants were...{62}
{5B}....can you guess?{57}They were monsters!{5E}
{5B}Are you going to defeat{57}the magician in the tower?{5E}
{5B}Wow!{57}You came back alive!{5E}
{5B}But the lighthouse cannot{57}exist without the {5F}!{57}Who would do such a thing?{5E}
{5B}If the tunnel between Verla{57}and Mercator could be{57}re-opened, Verla would be just{62}
{5B}a step away.  But a recent{57}earthquake blocked up the{57}tunnel.  So you can only{62}
{5B}get to Verla by sea, now.....{5E}
{5B}One of my relatives{57}runs a shop in Verla.{5E}
{5B}General Arthur struggled{57}with the Duke to the last.{5E}
{5B}Would you like a fruit drink?{57}How about my Dahl Delight?{62}
{5B}It's the choice of a{57}new generation!{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is now{57}recruiting mercenaries to{57}mount an attack against Mir.{62}
{5B}They're having a victory{57}celebration in advance.{5E}
{5B}Nigel!{57}Is it true you defeated Mir?{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator ran out on{57}the town!  What a surprise!{62}
{5B}What are we going to do{57}now?{5E}
{5B}I've remodeled!{57}You can order from upstairs{57}and not even get out of bed!{62}
{5B}Go upstairs and{57}order something.{5E}
{5B}Where is she?...sigh!...{57}...where is she now...{57}oh!  Are you a tourist?{62}
{5B}Will you hear my story?{58}
{5B}Needless to say, I'm Ludwig,{57}the world-famous composer{57}from the continent.{62}
{5B}Princess Lara came here{57}to study under me, but then...{62}
{5B}she just vanished!!{57}I'm afraid my lessons weren't{57}good enough for her...{62}
{5B}She might at least say{57}good-bye before leaving...{57}Sigh!...how cute she was....{5E}
{5B}Oh, please listen....{58}
{5B}I felt a bit sick, so I{57}came out here.  Princess{57}Lara?  Well, she's...{62}
{5B}Particular...yes, particular!{57}Actually, she's{57}very hard to deal with.{62}
{5B}Perhaps her fussiness{57}irritated the Duke so much{57}he sent her back home.....{5E}
{5B}That Ludwig is a bit of a sap!{57}I think he's out of his head{57}over this princess babe....{5E}
{5B}Ludwig?  After returning{57}from the castle, he guzzled{62}
{5B}six Diet Dahls.  Six!  Then{57}he became unruly, so I{57}had to throw him out.{5E}
{5B}How sensitive that Ludwig is!{57}He seemed so shocked when{57}I asked him to leave.{62}
{5B}Now he's gone off{57}somewhere, probably to{57}lick his wounds.....{62}
{5B}These artist types sure{57}are hard to understand.{5E}
{5B}General Arthur's alive!{57}Happy, happy!  Joy!  Joy!{57}Let's party!{5E}
{5B}Huzzah!  Huzzah!  Let's hear{57}it for lower taxes!  Look out,{57}Mir, I'm comin' to getcha!{5E}
{5B}TOGA!  TOGA!  TOGA!{57}Hey, you!  Barkeep!  Another{57}round of Dahl Delights!{62}
{5B}Are the taxes lowered yet?{57}Did they get that Mir guy?{57}Who cares?  Let's party!!{5E}
{5B}Have you been to the{57}casino yet?  It's exciting!{5E}
{5B}The men in this town{57}seem to be falling{57}head over heels{62}
{5B}for some new cutie{57}from the continent.....{5E}
{5B}Welcome back, hero!{57}...but...why so troubled?{57}Anything wrong?{5E}
{5B}Is the rumor about the{57}Duke true?  If so, he must{57}really be a wicked man!{62}
{5B}He was always smiling and{57}pretending to serve the town.{5E}
{5B}General Arthur and his{57}new casino are the{57}talk of the town now.{5E}
{5B}Take it from me, kid!{57}Never, never, NEVER give{57}your heart to a girl!!{5E}
{5B}Ah, Princess......{57}Zzzzzzzz.....{5E}
{5B}I...feel sick...{57}to my stomach......{5E}
{5B}Not only do I feel sick{57}to my stomach, I think{57}I sprained my ankle.....!{5E}
{5B}Zzzzz...{57}Julie.....{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is originally{57}from the continent, so he{57}often invites guests from his{62}
{5B}homeland.  Just recently, a{57}noble girl named Lara came{62}
{5B}to study piano.  I haven't{57}seen her around, lately, so{57}maybe she went home.....{5E}
{5B}I heard about you!  You're{57}one of those mercenary{57}fellas who're going off to{62}
{5B}defeat Mir and restore the{57}peace!  We're expecting much{57}from you!  Waste that wizard!{5E}
{5B}Hey, hero!  How'd the{57}fight against Mir go?{57}Are you OK?{5E}
{5B}If the terrible rumor{57}about the Duke is true, it{57}must be a lie that it was Mir{62}
{5B}who caused the heavy tax.{5E}
{5B}Our family has been serving{57}the castle for generations.{57}Now my son is a cook, and{62}
{5B}my daughter is a maid.{57}They work for Duke Mercator.{57}You envy them, right?{5E}
{5B}My son told me that{57}you're going to the tower.{57}They say the tower{62}
{5B}is full of traps and snares.{57}Please be careful!....{5E}
{5B}Oh, Nigel!{57}You came back from the tower!{57}Amazing!{5E}
{5B}What a fool!{62}
{5B}Do you know the{57}importance of the{57}{5F}?{62}
{5B}Go to Greenmaze and{57}find the {5F}{57}by yourself!{5E}
{5B}Finally he's seen the light!{57}We've been preaching to him{57}for six hours!{5E}
{5B}Have you heard about{57}General Arthur?{58}
{5B}He's in charge of the{57}castle guard, now.  He's still{57}worried about the Duke's plot.{62}
{5B}He was seriously injured...{57}Now he's under{57}strict medical care.{62}
{5B}I think General Arthur is{57}worthy of becoming{57}Mercator's next ruler.{5E}
{5B}That Arthur is quite an{57}able statesman!  He opened{57}a casino to help lower taxes!{5E}
{5B}Heh, heh, heh...You'd better{57}leave....this place isn't for{57}sightseers.....heh, heh, heh...{5E}
{5B}Ah, welcome...to the{57}Mercator Champion Motel!{57}Heros check in, but they{62}
{5B}don't check out!.....{62}
{5B}Well, heh heh...there it is,{57}the underground crypt.{57}What're you waiting for?...{5E}
{5B}Both in this world and{57}the one below...heh heh heh...{57}you have to use your brain.{5E}
{5B}Heh heh, it was{57}good practice for you,{57}wasn't it?...heh heh...{5E}
{5B}Stand in front of the{57}counter, jump and throw{62}
{5B}It may be a little difficult,{57}but you'll get the hang of it!{5E}
{5B}Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da{57}GROW!  Soon you'll reap{57}ba-dee-da-do.....{5E}
{5B}Mom likes to sing!{5E}
{5B}Weigh anchors, weigh, yo-ho,{57}Waves breaking, weigh yo-ho{57}Hey-hey!  I'll teach mom{62}
{5B}a new song!{5E}
{5B}I don't know who's been{57}teaching him, but my son{57}likes to sing strange songs...{5E}
{5B}Ba-pa-da-da, dee-da{57}GROW!  Soon you'll reap{57}ba-dee-da-do......I like it!{5E}
{5B}I'm a guard at the castle,{57}but I'm off duty today!{57}I'm going to Greenpea's!{5E}
{5B}It's said that the{57}underground monsters are much{57}more cunning than us!{5E}
{5B}We wish you good luck!{57}While you're at it{59}...{59}...can you{57}get the taxes lowered?{5E}
{5B}I used to work at{57}the castle in my younger days.{62}
{5B}We almost never get invited{57}to the castle.  But I carry{57}with me the memory{62}
{5B}of its elegance...{5E}
{5B}The ship arrived from the{57}continent!  Let's go to the{57}monthly market!{5E}
{5B}Y'know, the rumor must be{57}true.  When my husband went{57}to Ryuma, he saw a young man{62}
{5B}casting the {5F} away.{57}It was the lighthouse keeper's{57}apprentice.  He questioned{62}
{5B}the boy and found that{57}Duke Mercator duped him into{57}stealing the Sun Stone!{62}
{5B}On hearing that, my husband{57}came back in a hurry, but{57}the duke had already gone...{5E}
{5B}The interrogation is still{57}going on upstairs.{5E}
{5B}They're still upstairs,{57}trying to set that young man{57}straight.  We have to prepare{62}
{5B}for the future.....{5E}
{5B}Remember the lighthouse{57}apprentice?  He's working{57}under General Arthur, now!{5E}
{5B}My friend works at the{57}castle, see,  and he says{57}there's a labyrinth in the{62}
{5B}basement.  And that's not all!{57}It's fulla creepy monsters,{57}too!  Yuckk!  Disgusting!{5E}
{5B}My friend also said that{57}rogues and criminals are{57}being held prisoner in the{62}
{5B}castle's underground prisons!!{57}Whaddaya think of that?!{5E}
{5B}Pop and the others are{57}upstairs grilling the{57}apprentice.  He's the one who{62}
{5B}broke into the lighthouse.{5E}
{5B}Yeah, they're still upstairs.{57}I think he's had enough.....{5E}
{5B}Somebody must take over{57}at the castle to keep order{57}in this town!{5E}
{5B}My dad and his friends{57}are upstairs discussing{57}the new casino.{5E}
{5B}A traditional town,{57}Mercator.  You have to behave{57}properly here.{5E}
{5B}I hope the evil magician{57}is defeated soon...and{57}our taxes get lowered.....{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is a kind{57}and friendly man.  He came{57}downtown the other day and{62}
{5B}spoke to each of us in{57}person.  I was{57}deeply impressed.{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is{57}WONderful!  He looks so{57}gentle, mild, and refined.{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is{57}WONderful!  He looks so{57}gentle, mild, and refined.{62}
{5B}Hello, sir!{57}Don't you look nice.....{5E}
{5B}Well?  How was it?{57}You saw Duke Mercator, right?{57}I envy you!{5E}
{5B}Well?  How'd it go?{57}You saw Mir, right?  Was he{57}as strong as they say?{5E}
{5B}What?  Duke Mercator was{57}really a wicked man?...Oh,{57}I saw him going to port{62}
{5B}with his soldiers{57}just a little while ago...{57}What's going on?{5E}
{5B}The duke was really one of{57}the bad guys?  I should have{57}listened to you before.....{5E}
{5B}We're getting used to{57}life without Duke Mercator.{57}What on earth could he be{62}
{5B}doing now?  What?  He's{57}still looking for the{57}treasures?  Hmmm.....!{5E}
{5B}This fortuneteller is famous{57}around here.  She can cast an{57}awesome spell on us!{5E}
{5B}Heh heh...I know, I know.{57}You asked her to cast a spell{57}upon you, didn't you?{62}
{5B}Well, go ahead!  Madame{57}Yard's is just across the way.{5E}
{5B}Her sorcery is so famous that{57}many people come all the way{57}from the mainland to see her.{5E}
{5B}How come a doghouse occupies{57}the best place in the town?{57}I just don't understand!{5E}
{5B}Well, I want to buy this{57}estate, but...is this dog{57}going to sell, or what?{5E}
{5B}Who actually owns this{57}estate, anyway?...{57}Duke Mercator, perhaps?.....{5E}
{5B}Did you know the duke{57}has fled?  Where will we be{57}without him?{5E}
{5B}See the sign?{62}
{5B}Now's my chance...{57}I've got the best plot of land{57}in all of Mercator!{5E}
{5B}Rats!  I've got the land,{57}but...now I have no money{57}to build a house on it!{5E}
{5B}Mercator Harbor is to the{57}south.  We have a regular{57}liner from the continent.{5E}
{5B}Our supply of goods will{57}flourish when the ship{57}arrives.{5E}
{5B}Good heavens!  The ship{57}can't leave because of the{57}trouble with the lighthouse!{5E}
{5B}Good heavens!  The ship{57}can't leave because of the{57}trouble with the lighthouse!{62}
{5B}Good heavens, the.....oh!{57}You fixed it?{57}Great!{5E}
{5B}Did you hear about the new{57}casino that opened recently?{57}It's an exciting place!{5E}
{5B}I often watch the officers{57}of the castle go in and out.{57}What do they do inside...?{5E}
{5B}When I grow up, I'll be a{57}member of the Royal Guard{57}and serve Duke Mercator.{5E}
{5B}Are you really going{57}to the Tower of Mir?  Are you{57}tired of living, or what?!!{5E}
{5B}Welcome back!{57}We thought you were dead!{5E}
{5B}I'm watching for invaders{57}from the tower.{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!  Bow-wow!{5E}
{5B}I didn't mean to take{57}the best spot in town!.....{5E}
{5B}I can tell you're a{57}real ladykiller...{5E}
{5B}Mom's work is almost{57}over for the day.{5E}
{5B}Madame Yard is my mom.{57}She'll be closing up for the{57}day, soon.  I bet she's tired!{5E}
{5B}Mom and I are going to the{57}continent to open up a new{57}franchise.  Please stop by!{62}
{5B}What?  Oh, you can{57}see what our business is{57}when you come!{5E}
{5B}Please fix the lighthouse{57}for my mom and me!{5E}
{5B}I've never been to the{57}continent before.  I was born{57}and raised on this island.{5E}
{5B}I was robbed!{57}That Greenpea's...{57}Absolutely robbed!{62}
{5B}I'm a corpse!  My wife'll kill{57}me!  How'm I gonna...I know!{57}I'll say I lost my wallet.....{5E}
{5B}I want to enjoy life{57}once again!  I'll ask her to{57}cast a spell on me!{5E}
{5B}I'm young!{57}I'm young again!{57}Hurray!{5E}
{5B}Oh, Fahl my love,{57}When will you see me?{57}I'm always thinking of you.{5E}
{5B}See?  See!{57}What is that girl doing in{57}his room!  I can't stand it!{5E}
{5B}Hear that?  Fahl has been{57}talking with that girl{57}all night long...!{62}
{5B}I'm getting jealous...!{5E}
{5B}I think it's time I{57}gave him up...{5E}
{5B}Mr. Fahl has many fans.{57}I'll admit he's strong and{57}tough, but......{62}
{5B}he's so old!  Why do{57}the girls all go for him?{5E}
{5B}I'm not sure when the{57}next ship comes.....{5E}
{5B}I just heard some horrible{57}screams....are my ears{57}playing tricks on me?{5E}
{5B}To tell the truth,{57}I'm a soldier from the castle.{57}It's my duty to stand guard{62}
{5B}here in disguise.{57}I'm proud of this job!{5E}
{5B}You're going to the{57}tower too?{57}How bold you guys are!{5E}
{5B}I don't know why, but{57}chills run up and down my{57}spine every time I'm{62}
{5B}near this place....Brrr!{5E}
{5B}Zak and Dexter?{57}They went down to the{57}crypt some time ago.{5E}
{5B}Hi!  You're another{57}treasure hunter, aren't you?{57}We seem to get a lot of them{62}
{5B}here lately.....{5E}
{5B}Wh...Who are you!{57}I'm busy.  Dont bother me!{5E}
{5B}This is the castle of{57}Mercator.{57}I cannot allow you inside.{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!  General Arthur{57}told us to let you go in.{57}Please go ahead.{5E}
{5B}I'd like to come along and{57}help, but standing here is{57}an important duty!{5E}
{5B}Company--salute!{57}Do come in!  Duke Mercator{57}is waiting for you!{5E}
{5B}Standing here like this{57}has been my dream!{5E}
{5B}Welcome to the castle{57}of Arthur!  Anybody can go{57}through this gate!{5E}
{5B}You have not been invited{57}by Duke Mercator, have you?{62}
{5B}This is not a place for{57}dirty little kids like you!{57}Get out of here!{5E}
{5B}Are you Nigel?  Hmmm...{57}...younger than I thought...{5E}
{5B}Going off to defeat Mir, eh?{57}Hope your mama's got{57}something black to wear!{62}
{5B}Hahahahaha!!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  You're alive!! I'm{57}impressed!  Duke Mercator will{57}praise you for your boldness!{5E}
{5B}You!  Halt!{57}...Heh heh, just kidding!{5E}
{5B}We are the first{57}kid-gatekeepers of{57}this castle.{5E}
{5B}Co-cock-o-o-oooo...{5E}
{5B}Why do men act like fools{57}when they fall in love?!{5E}
{5B}I made my fortune here,{57}so I'm going back to{57}the continent.{5E}
{5B}What bad timing!{57}I'm all ready, but the{57}ship can't leave!...{5E}
{5B}I think the money I saved{57}here will be enough for me{57}to start my own business.{5E}
{5B}I love the sea...{57}A brisk, salty breeze{57}makes me happy...{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator boarded the{57}ship with armored soldiers{57}I've never seen before!{62}
{5B}After they left,{57}the lighthouse suddenly{57}went out...{5E}
{5B}We were all so relieved to{57}see the lighthouse lit again.{62}
{5B}Oh!{57}You found the {5F}?{57}Really?{5E}
{5B}We can see many{57}unusual things when the ship{57}from the continent arrives!{5E}
{5B}Have you seen the{57}princess staying in the{57}castle?  She's so cute!{5E}
{5B}I finished unloading!{57}We'll go on a spree at{57}Greenpea's tonight!{5E}
{5B}As long as the lighthouse{57}is broken, the ship cannot{57}leave!{5E}
{5B}I come here once a{57}month with imported goods.{57}We sailors rely entirely on{62}
{5B}the lighthouse of Ryuma{57}because the island is{57}enveloped in a dense fog.{5E}
{5B}The lighthouse is{57}out of order!  How will I{57}steer my ship!{5E}
{5B}The ship for Verla{57}will be leaving port soon!{5E}
{5B}Weigh anchor, weigh yo-ho!{57}Waves breaking, weigh yo-ho!{57}Hey-ho, let's go!{62}
{5B}This is the new number{57}one song of the week on{57}the continent now!  Know it?{5E}
{5B}Weigh anchor, weigh yo-ho!{57}We're stuck here, way to go!{57}Hey, yo-ho, let me go!{62}
{5B}This is no time for singing!{57}The situation's critical!{5E}
{5B}The taxes here are{57}killing me!  Cut 'em short,{57}I say...end of story!{5E}
{5B}Sorry!  This warehouse{57}is for traders only.{5E}
{5B}Do come in and look around{57}the warehouse!  You're sure{57}to find something you like!{5E}
{5B}See you next month!{57}Have a good day!{5E}
{5B}Have you heard about{57}General Arthur?{58}
{5B}He was seriously{57}injured!  Now he's under{57}strict medical care.{62}
{5B}I think General Arthur{57}will make a great ruler!{5E}
{5B}He's in charge of the Royal{57}Guard, now.  His main concern{57}is foiling the duke's plans...{62}
{5B}He was seriously injured!{57}Now he's under strict{57}medical care.{62}
{5B}I think General Arthur{57}will make a great ruler!{5E}
{5B}Do you think those who{57}buy 100 EkeEke at a time{57}are stupid?  So do I!{5E}
{5B}Gambling is like a drug!{57}Once you get started, you{57}can never get enough!...{5E}
{5B}Greenpea is the name{57}of the owner here.{5E}
{5B}I'm the ship's captain.  I'm{57}just like anyone else on land,{57}but on the sea, I'm king!...{5E}
{5B}When the lighthouse is fixed,{57}I can go back to being a{57}captain again.{5E}
{5B}Ahoy, matey!  Didja hear?{57}The lighthouse is fixed!  I'm{57}a captain again!  Ha ha!!{5E}
{5B}This skeleton killed many{57}friends of mine!  This is{57}my revenge!{62}
{5B}If he were out of that cell,{57}I'd be no match for him!{5E}
{5B}To get the armlet is{57}to prove oneself worthy{57}to enter the tower!{5E}
{5B}Is that the armlet?{57}You really did it?  Gee...!!{57}If you were{62}
{5B}strong and smart enough to{57}get the armlet, Mir should be{57}no problem for you...{5E}
{5B}The goods you purchased{57}will be sent directly to your{57}shop with the bill.  Thanks!{5E}
{5B}This is Duke Mercator's{57}private pier.{57}You can't go in.{5E}
{5B}Welcome to{57}the castle of Mercator!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  I have great{57}respect for you!{57}You're my ideal!!{62}
{5B}Please, please come{57}back safe and sound!{57}Good luck...!{5E}
{5B}Please come back{57}safe and sound!{57}I'll pray for you!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  Welcome back!{57}Thank heavens the goddess{57}accepted my prayer!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!{57}I thought you were...{57}the Duke and some strange{62}
{5B}armored soldiers suddenly...{5E}
{5B}Terrible...!{5E}
{5B}All the other soldiers have{57}gone somewhere with the Duke.{57}I'm the only one remaining...{5E}
{5B}I am not fit to be a soldier.{57}I'll assist General Arthur{57}in his duties from now on.{62}
{5B}Take care of yourself!{62}
{5B}Beautiful courtyard, huh?{57}The gardener must be highly{57}skilled to keep it so nice...{62}
{5B}Would you like to see him?{57}Surprise!!...it's me,{57}heh, heh, heh...{5E}
{5B}Why did the Orc King{57}cross the road?{62}
{5B}Because he wanted to{57}eat the chicken{57}on the other side.  Ha!{5E}
{5B}Now the taxes will be{57}lowered and I can get{57}a better salary...I hope.{5E}
{5B}Strange!{57}Giant monsters like soldiers{57}were following Duke Mercator!{62}
{5B}How strange!.....{5E}
{5B}I don't care who owns the{57}castle.  I'll always be the{57}gardener of this courtyard...{5E}
{5B}Cock-a-doodle-dooooo!{5E}
{5B}Cock-a-cock-a-co....{5E}
{5B}Oh, this is the kitchen door!{57}A distinguished guest like you{57}should use the front door....{5E}
{5B}La-la-la...la-la...{57}Why am I so happy?  Well,{57}when I was cleaning the garden,{62}
{5B}I saw a beautiful hair{57}ornament fall to the ground, a{57}very expensive one!  Lucky me!{5E}
{5B}This door is not fit for{57}a hero!  Would you please{57}use the front door?{5E}
{5B}Strange armored soldiers{57}suddenly rushed into the{57}castle!  General Arthur is{62}
{5B}fighting against them alone!{57}Please save him!  HURRY!!{5E}
{5B}Where has the Duke gone?{57}What is he going to do?{5E}
{5B}The party will be{57}ready soon.  Please feel free{57}to look around the castle.{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel, the party is ready.{57}It's being held in the banquet{57}room on the second floor.{5E}
{5B}You can't go out now{57}It's getting dark.{62}
{5B}It's for your safety.{57}Please take a rest in your{57}room for the night.{5E}
{5B}Mir is a plague to the duke{57}and the town.  Please defeat{57}him for us!{5E}
{5B}I'm glad to see you again!{57}Please go up and see the Duke.{5E}
{5B}You cannot go out today.{5E}
{5B}Everything is ready!{57}Would you go on up{57}to the banquet room?{5E}
{5B}You can't go out today.{57}Please rest quietly in{57}your room.{5E}
{5B}We're counting on you{57}to return safe and sound!{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is{57}waiting for you!{5E}
{5B}Training rooms for{57}the soldiers from here.{5E}
{5B}Excuse us, sir!{57}The new employees often{57}behave rudely to the guests...{62}
{5B}I must humbly apologize{57}on their behalf.....please{57}forgive us.{5E}
{5B}Working here, I get to{57}see the nobility from{57}various countries.{62}
{5B}Just recently, I had a chance{57}to meet Princess Lara from{57}Maple.  She was really cute!{62}
{5B}But since then...{57}...nothing!{5E}
{5B}We are told not to speak{57}with the guests...{57}Please excuse me.{5E}
{5B}The paintings and ornaments{57}in this castle are{57}well known for their{62}
{5B}historic value.  Incidentally,{57}this picture is by the famous{57}Van Dough.  If you{62}
{5B}really want it, I'm sure{57}the duke would sell it to you.{57}Only 50,000 golds...cheap!{5E}
{5B}Collecting art{57}is the duke's hobby.{5E}
{5B}What a surprise!{57}Mr. Zak, the Dragonute, said{57}that he would buy this one!{62}
{5B}Is bounty hunting such a{57}good job?  Hmmmmm.....{5E}
{5B}This mansion is so large,{57}it takes me one whole day{57}to clean the walls...{5E}
{5B}Cleaning the walls is{57}very hard work.{57}So, I'm taking the day off!{5E}
{5B}Mr. Dexter?  No, I don't{57}know where he is now{57}He was gone by the time I{62}
{5B}came to clean his room.....{5E}
{5B}That's your maid over there.{57}She'll show you to your room.{5E}
{5B}An evil magician is{57}tormenting Duke Mercator.{57}The duke has been avoiding{62}
{5B}a direct confrontation{57}out of consideration for the{57}townspeople, but...{62}
{5B}you'll hear more about it{57}at the dinner party.{62}
{5B}You need some rest now.{5E}
{5B}There is a barrier at{57}the door to Mir's tower.{57}I think General Arthur{62}
{5B}discovered a way to break{57}it.{5E}
{5B}Nigel, hmm...I'm sure I've{57}heard that name before....{57}Of course!  You're the one who{62}
{5B}stole the Statue of{57}Jypta, aren't you?{58}
{5B}I knew it!  But don't{57}worry...your secret's safe{57}with me.....{62}
{5B}Yes, you are!{57}A veteran bounty hunter can{57}easily tell his fellow thief!{62}
{5B}But don't worry!  The{57}5000 Gold reward for your{57}head is peanuts to me!{5E}
{5B}This gorgeous castle is{57}well worth exploring.....{5E}
{5B}A dinner party!{57}Do they serve any of my{57}favorites, like raw meat?{5E}
{5B}You may tag along{57}behind me tomorrow{57}if you want.{62}
{5B}It must be kind of a{57}burden to be so puny!{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator was a{57}famous swordsman in Gamoor.{57}I look up to him.{5E}
{5B}To be invited by the duke{57}is a great honor!  I waited{57}over 20 years to get{62}
{5B}this chance...but you look{57}very young!  How old are you?{5E}
{5B}I would give my life to be{57}of any service to him!{5E}
{5B}I'm proud of my job!{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel, would you{57}please go to the banquet room?{5E}
{5B}I'm proud of my job!{5E}
{5B}Good morning, Mr. Nigel!{5E}
{5B}We have to take care of{57}VIPs everyday. It sometimes{57}wears my nerves thin.{5E}
{5B}Have fun at the party!{5E}
{5B}We have to take care of{57}VIPs everyday.  It can really{57}frazzle my nerves...{5E}
{5B}Mr. Zak and Mr. Dexter{57}took off early this morning.{5E}
{5B}I'm sorry, but we're busy{57}preparing for the party now.{5E}
{5B}Everyone is waiting.{57}Please come in.{5E}
{5B}I'm sorry, but Duke Mercator{57}has gone to bed.  He's not{57}feeling very well tonight...{5E}
{5B}Mr. Zak left{57}quite a while back.....{5E}
{5B}Arf, arf...{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!{5E}
{5B}I'm a member of the duke's{57}Royal Guard.  I'm guarding{57}the duke with my life!{5E}
{5B}The duke is a gentleman,{57}but a little nervous.{5E}
{5B}It is said that nobody{57}ever left that tower alive.{57}Please be careful!{5E}
{5B}I'm the duke's maid.{57}If you need anything, please{57}call one of the other maids.{5E}
{5B}It's time for the dinner{57}party.  The banquet room is{57}on the second floor.{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator is{57}out now.{5E}
{5B}This is the library.{57}I'm happiest when I'm{57}surrounded by a lot of books.{5E}
{5B}It's almost impossible{57}to get into Mir's tower.{57}That barrier cannot be broken.{5E}
{5B}I was surprised to see{57}two horrible monsters{57}following some great beauty {62}
{5B}out of the basement!{57}Who were they?  And{57}what were they doing there?{5E}
{5B}Hey boy!  Are you a rookie?{57}We have a banquet tonight,{57}so shake a leg!{62}
{5B}Oh!...are you a guest?{57}Oops!...er, um...{57}...excuse me, sir!{5E}
{5B}I'm worn out!{57}Catering a banquet is no{57}picnic!{5E}
{5B}Hiccup!...wooops...{57}Er, this cooking sherry needs{57}more salt!...hiccup!...{5E}
{5B}How selfish she is!{57}She told me, "I'm on a diet.{57}Serve me a special menu{62}
{5B}with no meat, no fish!"{57}I really don't like her!  But{57}a guest is a guest...{5E}
{5B}I don't like her!{57}She leaves the room untidy,{57}and her bathroom's always{62}
{5B}sloppy!  I've never{57}seen such an ill-bred woman!{5E}
{5B}We are not allowed to{57}speak with the guests.{5E}
{5B}We get to eat the leftovers{57}after the banquet.{62}
{5B}It's our only pleasure{57}in this job.{5E}
{5B}A lot of leftovers in there?{57}Oh, happy day!{5E}
{5B}I'm full!{57}Did you see that roast beef?{62}
{5B}I ate too much!  Never again!{57}By the way, do you know when{57}the next banquet is?{5E}
{5B}Ulp!  I'm sorry!  I'm...{57}Oh...who are you?{57}I thought you were my boss!{62}
{5B}He's always scolding me...{5E}
{5B}I'm just taking my break now.{5E}
{5B}I've been on break since{57}ten this morning!{57}Heh heh heh...{5E}
{5B}What?  The party's over?{57}Ahhh....breaktime!!{5E}
{5B}This stew must be{57}extremely delicious!  It's{57}been cooking for three days!{5E}
{5B}Banquets are a good{57}opportunity to show off{57}my abilities as a cook!{5E}
{5B}I was very disappointed{57}to see that almost no one{57}cleaned his plate!{62}
{5B}What happened in there?{5E}
{5B}When is the duke{57}coming back?  I have to{57}plan his dinner menu.{5E}
{5B}We're serving fried{57}Gamoor lobsters and scallops!{57}Seafood is{62}
{5B}one of the duke's favorites.{5E}
{5B}How was dinner?{57}The menu was really special,{57}wasn't it?{62}
{5B}I wish I had gone to the{57}banquet with you...What?{57}You didn't eat!  How come?{5E}
{5B}Mr. Zak eats only raw meat?{57}I had no idea!...{5E}
{5B}Did Mr. Zak like the{57}fried lobsters?{5E}
{5B}Have you looked around{57}the castle?{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!  The party is{57}ready now.  Would you please{57}come to the banquet room?{5E}
{5B}Please come to the{57}banquet room.  It's on the{57}second floor.{5E}
{5B}You cannot leave{57}just yet....{5E}
{5B}Long ago, there was{57}a huge war on the continent.{57}King Nole used this island{62}
{5B}as a base.  When the war{57}was over, the fortresses and{57}labyrinths were simply{62}
{5B}abandoned...many of them{57}stand to this day!{5E}
{5B}The Dark Wizard of{57}the tower is very cunning!{57}The tower itself is like a{62}
{5B}storied maze.  There is{57}also a barrier to protect the{57}wizard from outsiders...{5E}
{5B}I got a bonus today!{57}Want to go to Greenpea's and{57}watch me double it?{5E}
{5B}Oh, I'm sorry!{57}We thought you were one of our{57}soldiers!  Did we scare you?{62}
{5B}We have to study{57}new tactics everyday!{5E}
{5B}The other soldiers are{57}making the rounds outside.{5E}
{5B}Everyone's out training.{57}Me?  Well, uh...umm...{62}
{5B}I-I'm minding the store{57}while they're gone!{5E}
{5B}This is the newest formation!{57}How do you like it?{5E}
{5B}We modeled it after the{57}movement of some monsters{57}we saw in a cave.{5E}
{5B}Don't interrupt!{57}It's just training, but I still{57}have to concentrate!{5E}
{5B}Out of the way, kid!{57}This is serious.  I've got{57}60 golds riding on this fight!{5E}
{5B}Sir Nigel, welcome to{57}the castle.  Enjoy thy stay!{5E}
{5B}I think the party{57}is ready now.{62}
{5B}Why dost thou not go{57}to the banquet room?{5E}
{5B}Art thou really going to{57}the tower?  'Tis a very{57}dangerous place!{62}
{5B}Didst thou know there{57}is a magic barrier at the{57}entrance to the tower?{62}
{5B}My investigations revealed{57}that an armlet is necessary{57}to break the barrier{62}
{5B}'Tis somewhere in the{57}underground crypt next to the{57}church.  I keep sending{62}
{5B}my best scouts in there,{57}but somehow they never{57}seem to return...I think{62}
{5B}there must be traps or{57}some such protecting the{57}armlet.{5E}
{5B}Sir Nigel!{57}Get the armlet and{57}defeat Mir for the Duke!{5E}
{5B}Dexter and Zak came through{57}here a little while ago.  They{57}asked me how to break the{62}
{5B}barrier, and left for{57}the crypt.  Sir Nigel,{57}I must warn you that{62}
{5B}the monsters down there{57}are very intelligent.  Perhaps{57}Mir cast a spell on them.{62}
{5B}Remember- thou can'st{57}find the armlet if thou dost{57}rely on thy sword alone.{62}
{5B}Take care of thyself!{5E}
{5B}...go...upstairs{57}and... cut the... armor{5E}
{5B}Nice to see thee again.{57}As thou dost see, I'm{57}completely healed now.{62}
{5B}I'll do my best to make{57}Mercator a good home for its{57}people.{62}
{5B}I've been thinking about{57}the relationship between{57}politics and the militia for{62}
{5B}a long time, now.  Julie{57}and I have often discussed{57}it, and I'm now convinced that{62}
{5B}I can make this town{57}prosper without a{57}military force!{62}
{5B}So, I built a casino in{57}the town well to help lower{57}the taxes.{62}
{5B}Please drop by{57}if thou dost have the time.{62}
{5B}Visit me anytime!{57}Take care of thyself!{5E}
{5B}Hello again, Sir Nigel.{57}Do you want this?{62}
{5B}This room is reserved{57}for special guests.{5E}
{5B}Hey!  How did you{57}escape?!!  I'm not through{57}with you yet!!{5E}
{5B}Arrrrgh!  All I wanted was{57}a few, measly treasures!  Now{57}We're dead broke!{62}
{5B}This is another fine mess{57}you've gotten me into!!{62}
{5B}The way we could afford{57}to go back to the continent{57}was on the prison ship,{62}
{5B}so I had them arrest me!{57}But, phew!  What a stink!{57}I can't stand it in here!{62}
{5B}Stinky...slimy...YUK!!{57}Jailor!{57}Gimme a better room!!{5E}
{5B}I won't forget you{57}for this, Nigel!!  I swear one{57}day I'll pay you back!!{5E}
{5B}...burp!...{5E}
{5B}Give me those treasures!{5E}
{5B}Stiiiiinky...{5E}
{5B}...BURRRRP!!...{5E}
{5B}Slimeeeee...{5E}
{5B}All right, already!  Such{57}superior swordsmanship...{57}I was wrong, you convinced me!{62}
{5B}Go ahead, take the treasures.{57}They're all yours, if you'll{57}just stop hitting me!{5E}
{5B}Wandering about in this{57}basement has completely{57}tired us out!  Please go on{62}
{5B}ahead and save the princess.{57}The duke has taken Miss Lara{57}prisoner...please find her!{5E}
{5B}You came here just{57}following his words...{57}How innocent you are...!{5E}
{5B}My name is Old Gol.{57}I'm the keeper of Greenmaze.{57}My father was{62}
{5B}once a keeper, too.{57}What can I do for you?{62}
{5B}{5F}, hmmmm...{57}Yes, it's hidden in the depths{57}of this forest, but...{62}
{5B}The naughty little gnomes{57}that live here have{57}changed the routes{62}
{5B}Do you need tips about{57}walking in the woods?{58}
{5B}First, don't look at the{57}bottom of the trees.  If{57}you see a gap between{62}
{5B}the tops of two lines of{57}trees, it might be a route.{57}If you get stuck there,{62}
{5B}try jumping up.  There{57}might be a hidden step or{57}obstacle in front of you{62}
{5B}Also, there are many{57}underpasses.  Some are{57}shortcuts, and some are not.{62}
{5B}You should memorize the{57}surroundings before going{57}down the underpass.{62}
{5B}The {5F} is in{57}the northeast sector of{57}this forest.{5E}
{5B}You've found the {5F}!{62}
{5B}Perhaps you know this{57}forest better than me!  Will{57}you take my place?{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow{5E}
{5B}I shall never forget{57}your kindness!{5E}
{5B}Hi, nice to meet you.{57}I can't see you, but you look{57}fine.  Something to eat?{62}
{5B}I can't see you, but{57}you look happy.  Visit me{57}anytime you like.{62}
{5B}I can't see you, but{57}you look brave.{5E}
{5B}Good afternoon.{57}Make yourself at home.{57}Ho ho ho...{5E}
{5B}Arf!  Arf!{57}Bow-wow-wow!{5E}
{5B}We cannot return to{57}our original forms until that{57}miserable witch is defeated.{5E}
{5B}Thanks again for{57}all you've done!{5E}
{5B}I want to see Bell!{57}I want to see Bell!{5E}
{5B}Are you a tourist?{57}You'd better go back.  All{57}the townspeople were{62}
{5B}suddenly taken to the{57}mountains by strange soldiers.{57}I was fishing by the sea{62}
{5B}at the time...{57}All that's left are a priest{57}and a sick old man...{5E}
{5B}I heard  you rescued{57}the people of this town!{57}Bravo!  Well done!{5E}
{5B}...cough...cough...{5E}
{5B}It's a miracle!  My health{57}suddenly came back to see them{57}all returned safe and sound!{5E}
{5B}Why did Duke Mercator{57}take all the people away?..{5E}
{5B}I'm happy now that{57}everything's back to normal...{5E}
{5B}Get the monster, please!{5E}
{5B}We're all from Verla.{57}Duke Mercator forced us to{57}dig this mine.{62}
{5B}Our families were also{57}taken captive by his{57}soldiers...please save them!{62}
{5B}This mine consists of three{57}forked tunnels.  You'll find{62}
{5B}our friends caught somewhere{57}in the other two tunnels.{57}Please help us!{5E}
{5B}Whew!  What a relief!{57}No more digging!  Now I can{57}go back to my old job.{5E}
{5B}EEEEEEK!!!{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator suddenly{57}appeared in town and{57}ordered his henchmen{62}
{5B}to bring us here.{57}And I thought he was{57}such a gentleman...{5E}
{5B}Why did Duke Mercator{57}do such a terrible thing?{5E}
{5B}H-help!{57}S-somebody help!!{5E}
{5B}I was so scared!{5E}
{5B}I shall never forget the{57}fear I felt in the mines{57}for as long as I live.{5E}
{5B}We're OK! Kill him!{5E}
{5B}What was the duke{57}looking for in this{57}mine, anyway?{62}
{5B}He kept us digging{57}morning, noon, and night!{5E}
{5B}The duke and his soldiers{57}left for Destel.  The dwarves{57}in that village are all{62}
{5B}peaceful and good-natured.{57}They have no weapons to{57}protect themselves.{62}
{5B}I'm afraid it'll be{57}a slaughter...{5E}
{5B}Go!  GO!!....{5E}
{5B}What's Duke Mercator{57}doing now...?{62}
{5B}Nigel!  I really think{57}you're the only guy{57}who can defeat the duke!{5E}
{5B}Hold out!{5E}
{5B}The duke must have{57}sold us out for the treasures.{5E}
{5B}I know the mayor of Destel.{57}He comes here often to{57}buy fish.  He's a good man.{62}
{5B}He said they live{57}peacefully there, growing{57}lovely, scented flowers...{5E}
{5B}He'll kill us!!{5E}
{5B}There is a small village on{57}the west side of this mine.{57}I saw Duke Mercator marching{62}
{5B}with his soldiers along{57}the road that leads to{57}the village.{62}
{5B}Do you know anything{57}about it?{57}What's going on?{5E}
{5B}The tunnel between{57}Mercator and Verla is{57}finally open.{62}
{5B}I can go to{57}Greenpea's everyday!{62}
{5B}Being kept in that dark and{57}cramped tunnel for so long{57}really stressed me out!{5E}
{5B}eeeeEEEEK!!!{5E}
{5B}Thank you very much.{57}You looked so cool{57}when you were fighting!{5E}
{5B}Don't look at ME...{57}GET 'im!{5E}
{5B}I overheard the duke's men{57}say the digging was over{57}because they found{62}
{5B}what they were looking for.{5E}
{5B}I found the sword, but{57}I didn't tell the duke{57}about it!{5E}
{5B}Dig!  Dig!{5E}
{5B}I had my suspicions{57}all along that this was no{57}ordinary mine.{62}
{5B}But who would have{57}guessed that a legendary{57}treasure was hidden there!{5E}
{5B}I have to keep at it.{57}Our lives are depending{57}on this...{5E}
{5B}That tunnel in the mine{57}is the only way{57}to go to Destel.{62}
{5B}The sword?  We happened{57}to find it when we were{57}digging the tunnel.{5E}
{5B}I can't trust humans{57}anymore!{5E}
{5B}My house was ransacked{57}by many big soldiers!!...{5E}
{5B}Why are humans so rude?!{57}They came from out of nowhere{57}and trampled down our{62}
{5B}flower beds...{57}If they wanted the jewel,{57}they should have asked me...{62}
{5B}Jewel?  someone named{57}Mercator found it and{57}took it away.{62}
{5B}Why does he want such a{57}worthless thing?  Flowers and{57}seeds are prettier...and they{62}
{5B}smell good, too!{5E}
{5B}I was at the inn, talking{57}about the ancient cave under{57}this village, when some{62}
{5B}tourist suddenly rushed down{57}here, broke the seal, and{57}disappeared down the cave...{5E}
{5B}I've never seen such{57}rudeness in all my life!{5E}
{5B}I don't like the hectic{57}pace of life in crowded towns,{57}so I live here quietly{62}
{5B}with the dwarves.{62}
{5B}I think humans are wicked.{5E}
{5B}Once I went down and{57}tried to look into the cave,{57}but it was impossible.{62}
{5B}I don't think you can do it.{5E}
{5B}We just want to live{57}in peace...{5E}
{5B}Dwarves are quite pious.{5E}
{5B}I was scared!{57}The soldiers were{57}twice as tall as me!{5E}
{5B}Kindly's Item Shop!{62}
{5B}I'm kind!{57}My brother is not...{5E}
{5B}Welcome to the{57}village of Destel.{5E}
{5B}This well is the entrance{57}to an ancient cave where{57}monsters dwell.{5E}
{5B}Sometimes, late at night{57}you can hear something{57}roaring in this well...{5E}
{5B}My flowerbed was{57}ruined.....{57}What were they looking for?{62}
{5B}I don't think I have{57}anything they'd want.{5E}
{5B}Big, hulking soldiers rushed{57}into my house and demanded{57}to know where the jewel was!{62}
{5B}What were they talking{57}about?  I have nothing{57}but flower seeds.{5E}
{5B}Duke Mercator suddenly{57}appeared and bought every{57}last raft I had!{62}
{5B}He paid me a whole{57}6 golds for them!  He said{57}he was going to the shrine.{5E}
{5B}Sorry!  All sold out...{57}You can still get to the{57}shrine through the cave under{62}
{5B}Destel, but...{57}it's pretty dangerous.{5E}
{5B}Beautiful waterfall, huh?{57}The people of Destel take good{57}care to keep the water clean.{5E}
{5B}I make a good living here{57}off the treasure hunters{57}who visit this lake.{5E}
{5B}Hi, stranger.  You are{57}the first visitor we've had{57}in 300 years.{62}
{5B}Wh-what?  Another{57}dictator has risen to power{57}on the surface?{5E}
{5B}King Nole gave us eternal{57}youth in reward for building{57}his underground palace.{62}
{5B}I like the calm life here.{57}I don't want to go back{57}to the surface...{5E}
{5B}You have to go through{57}a huge and complex labyrinth{57}to get to the palace.{62}
{5B}The maze was designed{57}by King Nole himself.{62}
{5B}It's impossible even{57}for us to go through.{62}
{5B}What a greedy man he was!{5E}
{5B}There is no priest here,{57}but I've meditated on{57}the goddess for 300 years,{62}
{5B}so I am the substitute.{5E}
{5B}I worked for King Nole{57}so I could have eternal life.{62}
{5B}But now I just idle my{57}time away{59}...{59}...{59}sigh!...{62}
{5B}Got any comic books?{5E}
{5B}There are three monsters{57}in the labyrinth called{57}"Gehenna's Gatekeepers."{62}
{5B}You have to defeat them{57}to open the gateway{57}to the palace.{5E}
{5B}Hi!  The original owner of{57}this shop left one day 200{57}years ago and never returned.{5E}
{5B}Now, let's start{57}our adventure!!{5E}
{5B}Omigosh...a MAN!!{5E}
{5B}I have to tell{57}Grampa!{5E}
{5B}....{59}....o...{59}...au....{59}...{5E}
{5B}He's still sleeping...{57}He didn't seem to be{57}the lazy type.....{5E}
{5B}Let him sleep for a while.{57}You can stay in our village{57}as long as you want.{62}
{5B}Hurray!{57}That's a great idea!{62}
{5B}But we're in a hurry.{57}Nigel!  WAKE UP!!  It's time to{57}{64}continue our treasure hunt!{5E}
{5B}Hi!  Are you OK now?{57}...well...{64}Where is your friend?{57}Y'know, that mini-sized girl.{5E}
{5B}How dare you call me{57}"mini-sized"!!{57}You hairy brute!{5E}
{5B}Oops!  S-sorry!{57}Touchy, isn't she?{5E}
{5B}The people of Gumi came{57}and smashed the bridge!{57}The bridge is broken!{62}
{5B}They must be possessed{57}by evil spirits!!  Somebody{57}please tell the mayor!!{5E}
{5B}What a noisy boy!{62}
{5B}Allow me to introduce{57}myself--I'm Prospero.{57}What do you want?{5E}
{5B}Hmmm...you came here{57}looking for the treasures{57}of King Nole...{62}
{5B}I'm sorry, but I know{57}absolutely nothing about{57}the treasures...{62}
{5B}However, I did{57}come across a fragment of{57}a document from the{62}
{5B}legend of King Nole{57}just the other day...{62}
{5B}What did it say?{62}
{5B}"Long, long ago, in the{57}age of King Nole, a vast horde{57}of soldiers came to this land."{62}
{5B}But why here?  The war{57}was on the continent...{62}
{5B}What good is{57}an island to soldiers?{62}
{5B}They must have come{57}to protect something very{57}valuable of King Nole's...{62}
{5B}Of course!!  That's it!{5E}
{5B}Wait, wait.{62}
{5B}There's no reason to{57}assume they were protecting{57}the King's treasures!{62}
{5B}Maybe not, but{57}I can just feel it.{57}Anything else?{62}
{5B}I'll look it up in my{57}books.  Stop by later--I may{57}have something for you then...{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  A terrible tragedy{57}occurred soon after you left!{62}
{5B}After we managed to{57}fix the bridge, Gumi thugs{57}marched in and kidnapped{62}
{5B}Fara...!{57}Oh, my little girl...!{5E}
{5B}Hey, Nigel!{57}Look at the byroad!{57}We can go up the hill!{5E}
{5B}Look!  It's Fara!{57}Let's go down from here!{62}
{5B}OK!  C'mon!{5E}
{5B}Thumpa-thumpa, yo!{57}Sacrificial, beneficial,{57}nothing here is artificial,{62}
{5B}Undefiled, unbeguiled, please{57}accept this virgin child!{57}Thumpa-thumpa, yo!{5E}
Nigel held up {5F}{57}over the statue.{5E}
{5B}You!  How did you get{57}in here?  Don't disturb{57}our sacred ceremony!{5E}
{5B}Orc King!{57}Orc King!{5E}
{5B}Grrrrr....{57}Gaorrrrrrrrrr{57}GRAAWWRRRR!!!{5E}
{5B}Oh, Nigel...sigh!...{57}I just knew you'd come!{62}
{5B}I'd like to thank you again!{57}Please come to my house{57}when you've finished here!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  Thanks to you,{57}the people of Massan are{57}now our good friends.{62}
{5B}We'll repair the road!{57}Just stand clear for a sec...{5E}
{5B}1-2-3!{62}
{5B}Heave-ho!  Heave-HO!!{5E}
{5B}OK!  You can use the road{57}anytime, now!{5E}
{5B}I heard them!{57}I heard them!{5E}
{5B}The mayor was{57}killed by the thieves!{57}What a disaster!{62}
{5B}I have to tell{57}everybody in town!{5E}
{5B}Are you going to{57}the thieves' hideout?{58}
{5B}Let's go!{5E}
{5B}Why not?{57}It could be fun!{5E}
{5B}Are you going to{57}the thieves' hideout?{58}
{5B}Let's go!{5E}
{5B}Right.{57}We don't have to go.{5E}
{5B}Are you going back{57}to town?{58}
{5B}OK!  Let's go!{5E}
{5B}We have a lot left{57}to do here.{5E}
{5B}Hey, Nigel!{57}You didn't get all the{57}treasure chests!  Take a look!{5E}
{5B}Who goes there?!!{57}Why, you puny...you'll{57}never go back alive!{5E}
{5B}I don't know who you{57}are, but thanks!  I'm almost{57}dead from hunger and fright!{62}
{5B}Please visit me when{57}you get back into town!{57}I'm freeeeee!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  We have been{57}waiting for you!  I really{57}want to thank you!{62}
{5B}You can't imagine how{57}happy I am to return{57}to my job again!{5E}
{5B}Please take this.{57}I hope it will help you.{62}
{5B}You can get into{57}Mercator with it.{5E}
{5B}Hahahahahaha!{57}There you are!  Give me{57}that little witch at once!{5E}
{5B}Wally!  Ink!{57}Row to the shore!{62}
{5B}The shore!{62}
{5B}The shore!{5E}
{5B}What are you doing!{57}Hurry up!{62}
{5B}Oh, my....{62}
{5B}Drifting...away...{5E}
{5B}Noooooo!{57}Now we're dead ducks!{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  That's Gola,{57}one of the destructive gods{57}King Nole used to worship!{5E}
{5B}Look!{57}Five stones are inlaid{57}on Gola's body...{62}
{5B}Let me read it...Here's{57}the gist, "Collect all five{57}stones to get Gola's eye."{62}
{5B}Hmmmm...looks like{57}the rest is nearly rubbed off.{62}
{5B}...Hey!{62}
{5B}What?{57}You see something?{62}
{5B}Look!  Does the{57}shape of Gola{57}remind you of anything?...{62}
{5B}Of course!{57}It's a map of this island!{57}So, if Gola breathes fire...{62}
{5B}That means his mouth{57}is the volcano!  That's it!{57}And the five stones...{62}
{5B}...represent the locations{57}of the jewels!  Brilliant!{62}
{5B}Then Gola's eye must{57}stand for.........{5E}
{5B}No!  No!{5E}
{5B}Hahahahahaha!  Great!{57}Now I know the location of the{57}treasures!  Lucky me!{62}
{5B}Hand me that lithograph,{57}and your little friend can{57}go free!  OK?{62}
{5B}Help me, Nigel!{62}
{5B}Darn!{62}
{5B}Pass it!{57}Or he'll eat her up!{62}
{5B}Double darn!{5E}
Nigel handed over the {5F}.{5E}
{5B}Hahahahaha!  Good boy!{5E}
{5B}I don't need her{57}any more!  'Bye now!{5E}
{5B}Oooooo!!{62}
{5B}I'll never forgive her!{57}Nigel!  Nigel!{62}
{5B}...the...the lithograph...!{62}
{5B}No problem!  I saw{57}enough to remember the{57}location of the jewels!{62}
{5B}Let's go!{5E}
{5B}I only pretended{57}to be scared!{62}
{5B}Really?  That's the{57}first time I ever saw{57}such a thing...{5E}
{5B}Hello.  I'm Purin.{57}I'm twelve.  Madame Yard is my{57}mom.  Wanna play?{62}
{5B}I like you!{57}Would you be my boyfriend?{58}
{5B}Sigh!...oh, well.....{5E}
{5B}Hey, Nigel!{57}What are you thinking of?!{5E}
{5B}Wow-wee!{5E}
{5B}Mercator men tend to{57}do some pretty stupid{57}things for love...!{5E}
{5B}Oh, Julie!  Julie!{57}If ya won't marry me, I'll{57}throw myself offa this wall!{62}
{5B}I mean it!  No?{57}Okay, here goes!{57}1{59}-2{59}-3!!{5E}
{5B}Owie!{5E}
{5B}Only invited guests{57}are allowed to enter{57}the castel of Mercator!{5E}
{5B}This castle is no place{57}for a dirty little kid like{57}you!  Scram!  Beat it!{5E}
{5B}You can come in now,{57}but...{62}
{5B}you can't pass this gate{57}for free!   Heh, heh, heh...{62}
{5B}Listen.  I'm a little{57}strapped for cash, and{57}baby needs a new pair{62}
{5B}of shoes...{62}
{5B}Heh heh...I'll letcha in{57}for {5A} golds.  Whaddaya say?{58}
{5B}Hey, thanks!  You must be{57}rich!  Hey, tell you what...{57}if you want to double{62}
{5B}your money, there's a place{57}called Greenpea's in town.{57}You may gain, or you may lose.{62}
{5B}It all depends on your luck!{5E}
{5B}...Is that all?{57}OK, go ahead!{5E}
{5B}What a miser!{57}OK, go ahead!{5E}
{5B}I'm a master of{57}martial arts!  I can give you{57}a lesson if you want.{62}
{5B}Will you challenge me?{58}
{5B}Now, pay me{57}{5A} golds, OK?{58}
{5B}I'm sorry, but it's{57}my job.  I can't do it if you{57}don't have enough money.{5E}
{5B}Take care of yourself!{5E}
{5B}Do you want to hear{57}the rules?{58}
{5B}I'll change into various{57}monsters who will attack you{57}one after the other.{62}
{5B}I'll evaluate your{57}skill by the number of{57}monsters you defeat{62}
{5B}without getting hit.{57}Once you get hit, it's over.{62}
{5B}Your reward will be based on{57}the number of monsters you kill.{57}Got it?{62}
{5B}Now, ready...{59}set...{59}GO!{5E}
{5B}Now, ready...{59}set..{59}GO!{5E}

{5B}{5A} golds.  Take them!{62}

{5B}Oops!{57}Come again when{57}you have more money!{5E}
{5B}Are you nuts?{57}Don't you like gambling?{5E}

{5B}The faster the plate your{57}ball lands on, the more{57}money you win!  400, 100, 50.{62}

{5B}You look so powerful.{57}If I promise to pay you,{62}
{5B}would you do me a favor?{58}
{5B}The room upstairs is{57}a mess.  Would you put the{57}jars on the shelves neatly?{62}
{5B}Collecting jars is{57}my husband's hobby....{5E}
{5B}Fine!{57}I'll do it myself.{5E}
{5B}Thank you very much.{57}Here's your reward...{62}
{5B}Please help me again.{5E}
{5B}Collecting jars is his hobby.{57}Scattering jars and making{57}somebody put them back{62}
{5B}is my hobby.{5E}
{5B}I have a bad back.{57}Those jars are just{57}too heavy for me...{5E}
{5B}My dad works in the castle.{57}I sometimes come here and{62}
{5B}watch the way they work.{57}They look very busy!{5E}
{5B}I'm going to Madame{57}Yard's.  Take care of things{57}while I'm out.{62}
{5B}Yes, sir.{5E}
{5B}This is for you!{62}
Arthur's henchman{57}got {5A} golds.{62}
{5B}If the duke calls for me,{57}make up some excuse and{57}manage it as you see fit.{62}
{5B}Understood!{5E}
{5B}I've never seen such{57}dishonesty in all my life!{5E}
{5B}I know, I know.{57}The kids your age are all{57}dying to get in!{62}
{5B}Your wish is my command{57}{64}Hammina, hammena, hammana...{57}{64}Punworg Kool yob siht Ekam!{5E}
{5B}Voila!  You can get into{57}Madame Yard's, now!{57}Hee, hee, hee...{62}
{5B}Have a good time...{5E}
{5B}I can't cast a spell on{57}you now.  Go to the church{57}and get cured first.{5E}
{5B}Good afternoon!{57}First time here?  Madame{57}Yard's is for members only.{62}
{5B}Registration fee is{57}5000 golds, but we're offering{57}a one-day, free trial{62}
{5B}membership before{57}you decide to enroll.{57}Enjoy your session!{62}
{5B}Linda!{57}Show this gentleman to{57}his room!{5E}
{5B}Hi, I'm Linda!{57}First time here?  OK, let's{57}go upstairs!  Just relax!{5E}
{5B}Come this way!{5E}
{5B}Where are you going?{57}No, no!  That room is for{57}another gentleman.{5E}
{5B}Are you ready?{57}First, let me...{5E}
{5B}Nigel!{62}
{5B}What are you doing!{57}Stop that!{57}I hate you!  I hate you!{5E}
{5B}What the?...{57}Hey!  Calm down, little...{62}
{5B}The name's Friday, sister!{57}Got it?  Don't call me{57}"little," or "mini," or{62}
{5B}anything else!{62}
{5B}F-Friday!  I think you've{57}misunderstood...{57}This is a ballet studio!{62}
{5B}People come here to{57}release tension, develop{57}discipline, and gain poise{62}
{5B}to help them solve their{57}day-to-day problems!{62}
{5B}Madame Yard's only enrolls{57}adults because the stress{57}ballet puts on the body{62}
{5B}would warp a young boy's{57}bones.{62}
{5B}..........{57}{64}I...I...{64}I'm sorry...{57}I thought...Nigel...was...{62}
{5B}S-sorry, Nigel!{5E}
{5B}Alas!{57}...'tis a pity...!{5E}
{5B}Sirrah!{57}I would have a word with you!{57}Come here!{5E}
{5B}Fair Julie!{57}Shut the door, please...{62}
{5B}Okay, but...n-no violence!....{5E}
{5B}If anyone discovers I'm a{57}member here, I shall become{57}the laughingstock of Mercator!{62}
{5B}My secret must die...{57}{59}...with YOU!  En guard!!{5E}
{5B}No!{62}
{5B}....I...I...{64}I give up...{62}
{5B}You're a strong lad.{57}I knew it when I saw the way{57}you carried yourself{62}
{5B}with a sword.{62}
{5B}Since I cannot force{57}thy silence, I must ask thee{57}as a gentleman- please,{62}
{5B}tell not a soul thou hast{57}met me here.  If you promise{57}not to, I'll invite thee{62}
{5B}to the castle.  Duke{57}Mercator is now looking{57}for reliable mercenaries.{62}
{5B}The duke will be{57}well pleased to{57}see thy skill.{5E}
{5B}What is thy name?{62}
{5B}...Nigel.{62}
{5B}Then, I shall await thee{57}at the castle, Sir Nigel!{5E}
{5B}Welcome, Mr. Nigel.{57}I've heard stories of your{57}great work in Ryuma.{62}
{5B}Come this way.{57}Please look around the castle{57}later if you like.{5E}
{5B}Please stay here.{57}The duke will greet you{57}momentarily...{5E}
{5B}Deel Klesso ma hahm.{62}
{5B}I said,{57}"welcome to my mansion."{57}in Gammorian.{62}
{5B}Gentlemen, I have read{57}reports on each one of you.{62}
{5B}Nigel, you're originally{57}from Maple.  Your work{57}in Ryuma was excellent!{62}
{5B}Dexter, you come to us{57}from B'el-ar.  Your reputation{57}as a swordsman preceeds you!{62}
{5B}And last, but not least,{57}Zak, the pride and joy{57}of Drakkonia.{62}
{5B}You're known throughout the{57}land as a fearless{57}bounty hunter.{62}
{5B}I'd like to offer you each{57}an assignment.  Tonight,{57}I'm having a banquet{62}
{5B}in your honor.  We'll{57}discuss the terms in detail{57}at the party...see you then!{5E}
{5B}Your room is{57}ready upstairs.{5E}
{5B}I'll come and tell you{57}when the party is ready.{57}Please make yourself at home.{5E}
{5B}Hail, Sir Nigel.{57}This is the Training Room.{5E}
{5B}Please don't tell{57}a soul about Julie...{5E}
{5B}Please don't{57}tell a soul about Julie...{62}
{5B}By the way,{57}I think it's time{57}to go to the party.{62}
{5B}Why dost thou not go to{57}the banquet room?{5E}
{5B}Hahahahaha!{57}Nice to meet you again!{57}Hahahahahahaha!{62}
{5B}I've been waiting for{57}you!  Now, come here!{58}
{5B}Hey, Nigel!{57}I can't understand you{57}at all!  She's a rival!{62}
{5B}She snatched the{57}lithograph!  She looks{57}older than me!{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel, would you{57}please come to the banquet{57}room?  Everyone is waiting.{5E}
{5B}Sorry, Nigel...{57}I got a little excited...{5E}
{5B}You refused me!{57}I've never been{57}refused before!{62}
{5B}Ink!  Wally!{5E}
{5B}You were off your{57}guard when you saw her nude...{5E}
{5B}Please come in.{62}
{5B}I'm sure you're anxious{57}to hear what the Duke{57}has to say to you all.{5E}
{5B}As you know, an evil{57}magician lives in the tower{62}
{5B}Just outside of town.{57}He's a terrible nuisance{57}to me, and to this town.{62}
{5B}The name of this wizard{57}is Mir.  Ever since he{57}settled in that tower,{62}
{5B}we've been afraid for{57}our very lives...We've done{57}everything he asked.{62}
{5B}I sometimes thought{57}of sending soldiers to the{57}tower...but his strong magic{62}
{5B}might have harmed{57}the innocent citizens{57}of Mercator.{62}
{5B}So I've been giving{57}him all the golds he wants.{62}
{5B}But I will stand for it{57}no longer!{62}
{5B}...Oh, I...beg your pardon!{57}Perhaps I rambled on a bit...{62}
{5B}Shall I say it again?{58}
{5B}I think it's time we defeated{57}this Mir.  The peaceful town{57}of Mercator will{62}
{5B}never know true peace{57}as long as he lives.{62}
{5B}So, I sent for you.{57}I'd like YOU to defeat Mir!{57}Of course, I'm prepared{62}
{5B}to offer you a rich{57}reward.  It so happens I have{57}in my possession the{62}
{5B}Golan Emerald, one of the{57}national treasures of{57}this fair land.{62}
{5B}Dexter... Zak...and Nigel,{57}you'll be heroes throughout{57}this proud nation{62}
{5B}for all time!  May the{57}goddess help you three!{5E}
{5B}That's all I have to say.{57}Now, let's enjoy the banquet!{57}Do you like music?{62}
{5B}Let me introduce{57}the world-famous composer and{57}pianist, Mr. Ludwig.{5E}
{5B}Thank you.{57}Tonight, I shall play for you{57}my latest work.{5E}
{5B}Bravo!  That was wonderful!{57}Ludwig, may I have the title{57}of this darling opus?{62}
{5B}...I wrote it...{57}for Princess Lara of Maple.{62}
{5B}Duke, please tell me!{57}I have to know!  Why did{57}she disappear?!!...{62}
{5B}Enough!  Silence!{62}
{5B}Ludwig, you may{57}leave now.  Guards!!{57}Take him away!{5E}
{5B}If you'll all excuse me,{57}I suddenly feel...unwell.{62}
{5B}I think I shall{57}retire to my chambers{57}for the evening...{62}
{5B}Gentlemen,{57}please enjoy the party.{62}
{5B}I'm expecting{57}much of you!  Good luck.{5E}
{5B}Nigel, are you going{57}to bed for the night?{58}
{5B}Let's go{57}explore the castle, then.{5E}
{5B}...Nigel...Nigel!{57}Are you awake?{62}
{5B}.....ah{57}...yeah...z...{57}...z?...{62}
{5B}To tell you the truth,{57}I really should thank Kayla...{57}Know why?  Because if she{62}
{5B}hadn't chased after me{57}like that, I would never{57}have met you!...{62}
{5B}I don't know why,{57}but I feel so happy{57}just being near you...{62}
{5B}and...so...{57}Hey, are you listening to me?{57}Nigel?...Nigel!{62}
{5B}mm...mm.........{5E}
{5B}What will you do after{57}you get the treasures?{57}Go back to the continent?{62}
{5B}And what about me?{57}What should I do?{57}Nigel?...Nigel!{5E}
{5B}...Good night, Nigel!{5E}
{5B}Excuse me, Mr. Nigel?{57}I...it's about Princess Lara...{57}She's not really...{5E}
{5B}Hey, you!{57}What are you doing!{5E}
{5B}Look, Nigel!{57}Something's falling.{5E}
{5B}What a beautiful ribbon!{57}Did somebody drop it?{5E}
{5B}Hey, skeleton!{57}Yeah, you, Mr. Big Bad{57}Skeleton.  Remember me?{62}
{5B}Well look at you,{57}caught in a pen!{57}Hah hah!  C'mon!  C'mon!{5E}
{5B}Huh!  You don't act so{57}tough now, do ya?{57}Ha ha ha!{5E}
{5B}Would you invest{57}{5A} golds in me?{58}
{5B}Aren't you interested{57}in the money game?{5E}
{5B}Thanks, kid!{57}Wait here, I'll double{57}your money in a jiffy!{5E}
{5A} golds!{57}I always repay the kindness{57}I receive twice over.{62}
{5B}Hey, a buyer!{57}You want medicines?{57}Sure, we've got 'em all!{62}
{5B}Hey, a buyer!{57}You want variety goods?{57}Sure, we've got lots!{62}
{5B}We've got all kinds{57}of items, and of good{57}quality, too!{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh...{57}Here comes another victim...{57}Are you going to enter{62}
{5B}this Hall of the Undead{57}at all costs?{58}
{5B}Brave boy!{57}You have to solve{57}eight riddles in eight rooms.{62}
{5B}If you correctly solve{57}the riddle for the room,{57}the torch will go out.{62}
{5B}You can go to the{57}other side of the river when{57}all eight riddles are solved.{62}
{5B}But, if you fail...{57}heh heh heh...it'll be{57}the end of your life...{5E}
{5B}Go away!{57}Don't ever come here again!{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh...{57}there are still more riddles{57}to solve over there...{62}
{5B}Do you really want{57}to go across the river?{58}
{5B}Heh heh heh...Indeed.{57}You had better go back...{5E}
{5B}OK...heh heh...{57}I'll take you to...{57}Gehenna!!{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh...{57}So long...{5E}
{5B}...Impossible...{57}How is it you came back alive?{62}
{5B}...Are you going{57}back to town?{58}
{5B}Do as you like.{5E}
{5B}...C'mon...{5E}
{5B}I can see there's{57}something about you...{57}I don't know what it is...{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh...{57}Welcome back from the pit...{62}
{5B}Are you going back?{58}
{5B}Do as you like.{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh...{5E}
{5B}Heh heh...come back{57}anytime you like...the undead{57}are always waiting...{5E}
The magic barrier{57}prevented you from going in.{5E}
Nigel held the {5F}{57}up over the entrance!{5E}
{5B}Are you going in{57}at all costs?{58}
{5B}Go back now.{57}Never step foot in this{57}tower again.{5E}
{5B}Anything I can do for you?{58}
{5B}Go back right now!{5E}
{5B}Do you dare come in?{58}
{5B}I think you had better{57}go back...{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha ha ha!...{5E}
{5B}Pew!!  Smells bad!{5E}
{5B}You again!{57}Go away!  Go away!!{5E}
{5B}You don't have to feel{57}so ashamed.{57}It's not your fault.{5E}
{5B}You've done well.{57}Now, back to the dust.{57}from whence you came!{62}
{5B}Tser ot...fle Siht tup!...{5E}
{5B}Brave young man,{57}You're the first person to{57}reach the top of this tower.{62}
{5B}What is your purpose?{57}Why did you come to see me?{57}I'm...{5E}
{5B}Shut up!  We came here{57}to defeat you!{62}
{5B}The people of Mercator{57}will no longer bow down{57}to your wicked whims!{62}
{5B}Now, Nigel!  Get him!{62}
{5B}You won't listen...{57}All right, then.{57}Come on!{5E}
{5B}I give up!{62}
{5B}I..I...lost...!  How strong{57}you are!  You shall have{57}whatever you desire.{62}
{5B}Give me the jewel.  Also,{57}stop extorting money from the{57}good people of Mercator!{62}
{5B}The jewel is yours.{57}But it's not me making{57}the unbearable demands.{62}
{5B}It's the duke.{5E}
{5B}Really!??{62}
{5B}He's my brother.{57}Ever since we were little,{57}his one ambition has been{62}
{5B}to conquer the continent.{57}He'll commit any wrong{57}to achieve his dream!{62}
{5B}He finally shut me{57}up in this tower because I{57}used to admonish him{62}
{5B}for his crimes...{62}
{5B}Gosh!{57}The duke is such a...{62}
{5B}Yes...it's really the{57}duke who imposes this{57}heavy tax on them.{62}
{5B}I just live out my life here,{57}day by day, quietly waiting{57}for a true champion{62}
{5B}to appear...{62}
{5B}Duke Mercator is only{57}pretending to be a gentleman!{57}What a liar!!{5E}
{5B}The jewel is downstairs.{57}Once you've found it, I'll{57}send you back{62}
{5B}to the entrance to the tower.{5E}
{5B}I'm going to send you{57}directly to the ground, OK?{58}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!{57}You did it!{62}
{5B}The duke is waiting for you!{57}Tell us of your exploits at{57}the tower in detail!{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!{57}I'm very glad to see you!{62}
{5B}I'm anxious to see the{57}jewel you freed from the{57}tower!{5E}
{5B}I always try to be one step{57}ahead of the competition...{62}
{5B}Why, whatever's the matter?{57}You look positively ill...{62}
{5B}Well, maybe the sight{57}of a beautiful lady will{57}make you feel better.{62}
{5B}Miss Kayla Kozwalski!{5E}
{5B}Hahahahahaha!{5E}
{5B}Well done, boy!{57}Ol' Duke and I agreed to share{57}the treasures of King Nole!{62}
{5B}You went to the tower{57}FOR us!  Hahahahahaha!{57}What a useful errand boy!{62}
{5B}Wally!  Ink!{57}Don't you agree?{62}
{5B}Agreeeee!{62}
{5B}Agreeeee!{62}
{5B}Hahahahaha!{57}Do you want to go to get{57}two more jewels for us?{62}
{5B}Hahahahahaha!{57}The treasures are ours!{5E}
{5B}Hahaha...uh-oh!{62}
{5B}Ohhhhhhhh!....{62}
{5B}Noooooooo!.....{5E}
{5B}What a bunch of dweebs!{57}Those treasures are all mine.{57}Share?  No way!{62}
{5B}Soldiers!{57}Take the jewels from Mr. Nigel!{5E}
The red and purple jewels{57}were taken away from Nigel!{62}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!  Have a{57}good time with that{57}silly old cow!  Ha ha ha!{5E}
{5B}Hey!  How did you escape?{57}You haven't seen{57}the last of us!{62}
{5B}Give me the treasures!{62}
{5B}Help meeee!{5E}
{5B}Thank you very much.{57}I almost gave up hope...{62}
{5B}Me?  I'm Moralis, the{57}Educational Minister of Maple.{62}
{5B}I'm the personal custodian{57}of Princess Lara De Wissica.{62}
{5B}Well, where is the princess?{57}I have to look for her!{57}Princess!{5E}
{5B}No!{57}Don't touch me!{57}P-please...don't touch me!{5E}
{5B}I'm warning you...{57}I have a knife!{62}
{5B}.......{57}What?{57}......{62}
{5B}You came to save me?{57}...Really...?{62}
{5B}Duke Mercator locked{57}the princess up somewhere{57}in the castle.  Save her!{5E}
{5B}ARRRRRRRRR!!{57}It's the end of the line{57}for you!{5E}
{5B}GARRRRRRRR!!!{57}Elf boy fall down, go BOOM!{5E}
{5B}HARRRRRRRR!!!{57}Time for all little boys to{57}go dead...er, bed!{5E}
{5B}Hello, boy!  I watched{57}your funny little adventure in{57}Mir's tower from the wings.{62}
{5B}You know, I knew{57}Duke Mercator was{57}an untrustworthy man...{62}
{5B}but he is much worse{57}than I thought.  Still, I{57}knew he'd never give us{62}
{5B}the Gola Emerald, so{57}while you were loitering in{57}the hole, I found a new job.{62}
{5B}I'm sure this princess will{57}carry a good price!{57}Heh heh heh...See you!{5E}
{5B}You came to save me,{57}right?  Wow, cool!  It's{57}always been my dream{62}
{5B}to be saved by a prince!{57}Wow!  Now, get this{57}lounge lizard and save me!!{5E}
{5B}L...lizard?  I'm a{57}Drakkonian, not a lizard!{57}Anyway, off we go!{5E}
{5B}Hey!  Where are{57}you going?  Help me!{57}Save me, my prince!{5E}
{5B}Stay there!{57}Or this noisy girl will{57}fall to her death!{62}
{5B}'Bye, Nigel!{57}it was nice meeting you!{57}Perhaps some other time!{5E}
{5B}Wow!  I'm flying!  See?{57}I'm flying!  Say!  Are you{57}licensed by the AFA?{62}
{5B}My prince!{57}Please come save meeeee!{5E}
{5B}Ouch...!{5E}
{5B}Sir Nigel!{62}
{5B}My lord, the duke{57}heard about the secret{57}treasures from those three{62}
{5B}and stole away on a{57}ship...after breaking the{57}lighthouse to prevent us from{62}
{5B}following him...Listen!{57}Go around to the east wall of{57}the castle and open the door.{62}
{5B}There is a hidden{57}switch to open the gate to{57}Greenmaze...{62}
{5B}The gate will appear{57}at the fountain...{57}To fix the lighthouse...{62}
{5B}Thou must go to{57}Greenmaze and find the{57}{5F}...{62}
{5B}Go upstairs{57}and cut the armour...{5E}
{5B}Hurry!{57}Follow the duke as soon as{57}you can!  Don't let him get{62}
{5B}the treasures!{57}He's a devil...{62}
{5B}Nigel!{57}We're counting on thee{57}to stop the duke!...{5E}
{5B}Oh, it's you!  While I{57}was looking for the exit, I{57}happened to find this place.{62}
{5B}W-what?!  Princess Lara{57}was kidnapped by the duke!?{57}What a wicked man!{62}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!{57}I trust in you!{57}Please save Princess Lara!{62}
{5B}Duke Mercator once{57}asked me about a book called{57}"A War History of King Nole".{62}
{5B}The book had been handed{57}down for generations in the{57}Royal Family of Maple, but{62}
{5B}the book itself no longer{57}exists.  The Princess knows{57}the contents by heart,{62}
{5B}however, and I think{57}the duke wants to use her{57}as a key to the treasures{62}
{5B}hidden in the book.{62}
{5B}Please get the princess{57}back from Duke Mercator!{5E}
{5B}La-la-la,{57}we like to make people lose{57}their way in the forest!{62}
{5B}La-la-la,{57}we like to see people walking{57}around in Greenmaze!{5E}
{5B}Hello!{57}You're lost, aren't you?{62}
{5B}You're lost!{62}
{5B}Ha ha! You're lost!{5E}
{5B}Look, Nigel!{57}This dog is badly hurt!{62}
{5B}Poor dog!{57}I'll cast a spell on you{57}to make you better.  Nigel!{62}
{5B}Give me an {5F}!{58}
{5B}Thanks!{57}It's all right, poor dog!{5E}
{5B}Good!  He looks much{57}better, now.  If only I were{57}better at using magic.{62}
{5B}'Bye-bye!{57}Be careful!{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow-wow!{62}
{5B}Nigel...he seems to{57}be calling us...!{57}Let's follow him!{5E}
{5B}But...he's nearly{57}dead!  Please!{58}
{5B}I hate you!!{5E}
{5B}You don't have any {5F}?{57}Quickly!  Get some and{57}hurry back so I can cure him.{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow-wow!{5E}
{5B}Thank you, Nigel and Friday.{57}You saved my dog's life.{57}He's my best friend.{5E}
{5B}Just a minute!{57}How come you know our names?{57}You might be the duke's...{62}
{5B}No, no!{57}Einstein told me.{57}Einstein is my dog.{62}
{5B}You mean to say{57}this dog can...he told{57}you our names?{62}
{5B}Yes, he did!{57}Please...take this{57}in return for your kindness.{62}
{5B}Now you can talk with any{57}dog you meet!  Why don't you{57}try it with Einstein?{62}
{5B}Really?{57}What a wonderful whistle!{57}Nigel, try it!{5E}
{5B}Thanks, Nigel!{57}I was attacked{57}by savage Forest Orcs!{62}
{5B}But thanks to you,{57}I'm alive and well, now!{62}
{5B}Visit me anytime!{5E}
{5B}Oh!!{57}Don't frighten me like that!{5E}
{5B}The view from here is{57}splendid, huh?{57}'Bye, now!{5E}
{5B}Tag!{57}You're it!!{5E}
{5B}You're very lucky!{57}That's it!{5E}
{5B}Woah!  That made me dizzy!{5E}
{5B}Listen carefully!{57}Dne daed a si siht!{5E}
{5B}Just a little further,{57}and you'll find...{59}a...{57}dead end!  Hahahah!{5E}
{5B}You don't need me?{57}{59}Bye-bye!{5E}
{5B}You're off guard!{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha ha!{57}Try once more!{62}
{5B}Next time, I'll give{57}you something good!{5E}
{5B}You've got grit!{57}...OK, I'll give you a hint!{57}Can you see a vine down there?{62}
{5B}You can take a short cut{57}if you go down there..{62}
{5B}Got it?  'Bye!{5E}
{5B}You're doing very well!{57}But you're still{57}confused, aren't you?{62}
{5B}I'll give you a hint!{57}Go down here and head{57}south.  When you come to a{62}
{5B}dead end, go up the{57}invisible stairs and jump{57}down!  There you'll find...{5E}
{5B}I can't see you, but{57}I'm glad to meet you.{62}
{5B}I'm having my lunch.{57}I can't see it, but it looks{57}good.  Would you like some?{62}
{5B}You're in hurry?{62}
{5B}I'll give you this.{57}I can't see it, but it{57}sure looks good.{62}
{5B}I enjoyed talking{57}with you!  I can't see you,{57}but you're still my friend.{5E}
{5B}Good luck!{57}I can't see you, but{57}good luck!{5E}
{5B}Nigel, look!{57}I can see something shining{57}over there! The {5F}!{62}
{5B}But we can't{57}get through those trees...{5E}
{5B}No, don't give up now!{57}not when it's before{57}our very eyes!{5E}
{5B}Oh, I know!{5E}
{5B}Let's call Einstein here!{57}I think he knows{57}how to get there.{62}
{5B}But how?{62}
{5B}With your whistle!{57}Give it a try!{5E}
{5B}Maybe we should{57}start over from the{57}very beginning...{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!{57}Nigel needs my help!{62}
{5B}How do you know?{62}
{5B}I can just make out{57}the sound of his whistle.{62}
{5B}He must be in trouble,{57}Einstein!  Can you go to him?{62}
{5B}Of course!{57}I'm a dog, remember?{57}I'll sniff him out!{62}
{5B}OK, let's go!{5E}
{5B}Nigel...{57}I heard a dog barking!{57}It must be Einstein.{5E}
{5B}Bow-wow!{57}Nigel!  Friday!{62}
{5B}What's the matter?{57}...Ah, these trees...?{62}
{5B}Let me help you!{57}Step back and stay there!{5E}
{5B}Finished!{62}
{5B}I'm only too glad{57}to help you, Nigel!{62}
{5B}We're going back, now.{57}Please visit me anytime.{62}
{5B}Thanks!  Take care!{62}
{5B}You too, Friday!{57}'Bye!{5E}
{5B}My name is Kado.{57}I was once a famous{57}swordsman.{62}
{5B}I used to work at the{57}castle, but retired.  I didn't{57}like town life.{62}
{5B}Are you a treasure{57}hunter?  Then you must need{57}a better sword than that...{62}
{5B}It has a special power.{62}
{5B}When the sword is fully{57}charged, a magic flame will{57}burn any enemy it touches!{62}
{5B}I think you can{57}appreciate the value{57}of the sword.{62}
{5B}How do you like it?{62}
{5B}There are other magic{57}swords somewhere on{57}this island.{62}
{5B}They are called{57}{5F} and {5F}...{62}
{5B}Also, I don't know if it's{57}true, but there's supposed{57}to be a legendary Gaia Sword!{5E}
{5B}Oh, the {5F}!{57}How did you get it?!  I can{57}fix the lighthouse with this!{5E}
{5B}Yo-ho!{5E}
{5B}Thanks to you,{57}the lighthouse is now{57}completely restored!{62}
{5B}I locked it up{57}so we won't have to go{57}through that again!{5E}
{5B}It's all set!{57}Let's go!{5E}
{5B}The town of Verla!{57}All ashore that's{57}going ashore!{62}
{5B}We still have a ways{57}to go!  'Bye, now!{5E}
{5B}Everybody set?{57}let's go!{5E}
{5B}The ship will soon set sail{57}for Verla!  You can get on{57}for free because you{62}
{5B}fixed the lighthouse!{57}Getting on now?{58}
{5B}Get on board!{57}We're leaving soon!{5E}
{5B}We have to leave now!{57}Step lively!  And, don't{57}bother the other passengers!{5E}
{5B}OK, I'll{57}wait a while for you...{5E}
{5B}Nigel, are you OK?{57}Are you a landlubber?{57}Don't throw up on my{62}
{5B}nice, new deck!{5E}
{5B}YAAAAAAARG!!!{57}RRRAAAAARG!!!{5E}
{5B}Do you want to die{57}so early?  RRAAAAAWRRR!!!{62}
{5B}They call me Slasher!...{57}...just before they DIE!{62}
{5B}I'm the manager of the{57}west tunnel Royal Guard{57}under Duke Mercator!{62}
{5B}GRAAAARRR!!!{5E}
{5B}YAAAARRRR!!!{62}
{5B}You are about to die{57}at the hands of Marley!{62}
{5B}I'm the Captain of{57}the Royal Guard #3{57}under Duke Mercator!{5E}
{5B}Thank you!{57}I don't know who you are, but{57}I really thank you!{5E}
{5B}Are you that runt Nigel,{57}the one who's always running{57}after Duke Mercator?{62}
{5B}I'm Dex,{57}the east tunnel manager{57}of the Royal Guard #7!{62}
{5B}Duke Mercator rules!{62}
{5B}BLAAAAAARRRR!!!{57}GLAAAAARRRR!!!{5E}
{5B}We have been secretly{57}digging an escape tunnel.{62}
{5B}We are experts in{57}digging, now, thanks to{57}Duke Mercator!{5E}
{5B}See!{57}It will be opened soon!{5E}
{5B}We were discussing{57}what kind of present to{57}get you.{62}
{5B}We found a sword in the{57}mines while we were digging.{64}{57}Go to the well and take it!{5E}
{5B}Hi, cutie!{57}Would you be my...{5E}
{5B}....Never mind!{57}Good luck!{5E}
{5B}Gee!{57}How'd you get here so early?{62}
{5B}I'll never let you win!{57}That treasure's mine!{5E}
{5B}What does it say?!{57}.....got it!....{57}So long, sucker!{5E}
{5B}Ouch!!!{57}Aughhhh!{5E}
{5B}NOOOOO!!!{57}akkggghhh...........{5E}
{5B}Mmmmm!...Bright boy brains!!{57}love to eat them up{57}everyday....yum!!{62}
{5B}Heh heh.....{5E}
{5B}Rats!  Somebody,{57}tell me the way I should go!{57}We're completely lost!  Wally!{62}
{5B}This is all your fault!{57}Our precious jewel has{57}gone to the duke!!{62}
{5B}Take that!!{5E}
{5B}Ooooouuch!{62}
{5B}Ha, ha, ha{62}
{5B}Find the way out!{57}Hurry!{5E}
{5B}Well, hello, Nigel!{57}Are you still alive?{57}Pity.{62}
{5B}But it's the end for you!{57}You can't follow me any more!{62}
{5B}While you're there stamping{57}your foot with vexation, I'll{57}be finding the last jewel.{62}
{5B}Hah hah hah!!...{57}So long, Nigel!{62}
{5B}I'm always one step{57}ahead of you!{5E}
{5B}Look, Nigel!{57}There goes the duke...!{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha!{57}The view from up there must{57}be great, huh?{62}
{5B}Can you hear me?{57}Shall I speak louder?{57}Ha ha ha!  See you!{5E}
{5B}What a hateful man!{57}Nigel, let's go down and look{57}for a way to follow him.{5E}
{5B}Why are you so{57}stubborn?  I guess I've{57}underestimated you!{62}
{5B}Come on, Nigel...let's have{57}at it!  It's a great honor{57}to be killed by my sword!{5E}
{5B}Impossible!...{59}I-I...{59}you...{5E}
{5B}Excellent, Zak!{57}Ha ha ha ha!{57}Got you, elf-boy!{62}
{5B}My duty is over!{57}You'll never make me pull{57}such a mean trick again!{62}
{5B}I despise you.{57}I'm going back home!{57}Hasta la vista!{62}
{5B}Wait!  Come back!{57}I need your...{57}{64}W-whaaa...?  What's this?{5E}
{5B}Nigel!  Friday!{57}Are you OK?{57}Owt...{59}es'Eht...{59}e-Viver es'Aelp{59}.{59}.{59}.{5E}
{5B}What a narrow escape!{62}
{5B}Duke Mercator always seems{57}to hold a trump card{57}up his sleeve.{62}
{5B}As you know, the duke wants{57}to conquer the whole{57}world with those treasures.{62}
{5B}Please stop him!{57}I'll be watching over you.{62}
{5B}To prove my words,{57}I'll give you a{57}helpful magic spell.{62}
{5B}You can cut the sacred trees{57}with it.  One of them is in{57}front of this tower.{62}
{5B}The duke's already got{57}the five jewels that{57}open the door to the{62}
{5B}legendary underground{57}world.  Go to the mountains{57}northwest of Mercator.{62}
{5B}You can get there{57}through the north gate{57}of the castle.{5E}
{5B}Ah, good...you escaped!{57}I'm sorry about what happened{57}at the shrine.{62}
{5B}That was a job.{62}
{5B}But now my debt to the{57}duke is paid.  This is{57}just between us!{62}
{5B}It's a pleasure to{57}fight against an equal!{62}
{5B}If you want to catch up{57}with the duke, defeat me,{57}and I'll tell you where he is!{5E}
{5B}Stop it!  STOP!!{62}
{5B}What's fair about this?{57}You have the advantage{57}up here!{62}
{5B}Do you have enough brains{57}to understand the meaning{57}of the word "fair"?{62}
{5B}Wha....?!{57}Fine.  Then we'll move{57}to a more "fair" situation!{62}
{5B}That plain ground to the{57}north would be just fine.{57}Come after me!{5E}
{5B}Is this all right{57}with you, little sister?{57}Is this fair?{62}
{5B}Good...let's do it!{62}
{5B}You...you won!{57}I can't believe you're{57}just a kid!{62}
{5B}Here, take this!{62}
{5B}Use it in front of the{57}statue of the goddess under{57}the bridge to follow the duke.{62}
{5B}I hope to challenge you{57}again, so...{59}come back alive!{5E}
{5B}Specially selected{57}goods are waiting for you!{57}Just for you!{5E}
{5B}Buy now, or you'll{57}have to wait a whole month!{5E}
{5B}Thank you, thank you!{57}See you again!{57}See you next month!{5E}
{5B}Ah, yes!  {5F}!{5E}
{5B}Do you like it?{58}
{5B}I'll send it{57}directly to your shop!{5E}
{5B}What makes you hesitate!?{5E}
{5B}No kidding!{5E}
Nigel held up {5F}!{5E}
{5B}You again!{62}
{5B}I think it's time{57}to stop playing tag with you!{57}Come here!{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha!{57}Look!{62}
{5B}These beautiful jewels{57}will lead me to...{57}{59}...the treasures!{5E}
{5B}Princess Lara!{57}Sing the song you learned{57}in your childhood,{62}
{5B}or I'll bust you in the head!{62}
{5B}N-no!  No, no!  No!{57}I'll never sing it for you!{57}I would rather die!{62}
{5B}Good.{57}I didn't think you were{57}afraid of death.{62}
{5B}How about this- sing{57}the song, or I'll put a{57}frog in your dress!{5E}
{5B}Eeeeeeeee!{57}Noooooooooooo!{62}
{5B}...O-OK...{57}you...win...!{62}
{5B}Oh, guardian{59} of the{57}darkness...{59}When the five{57}stones gather{59} here...{62}
{5B}show to me...the{57}secret passage!{57}{59}In-nah{59} Gad'da{59} da{59} V'idda!{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha ha!{57}The legendary treasures will{57}be mine!  Ha ha ha ha!{5E}
{5B}Oh, my prince!{57}I just knew you'd{57}come to save me...!{62}
{5B}You are my prince!{57}Oh, it's just like a fairy tale{57}come true!{5E}
{5B}Ever since the duke{57}trapped me in that{57}castle tower, I've been{62}
{5B}dreaming of the day you'd{57}come to save me!{57}Oh, my prince!{62}
{5B}I'm so happy!!{57}You're so much cuter{57}than I expected!{62}
{5B}But...what's this?{57}Oh, my prince!  You're{57}wounded!  Bad germs could{62}
{5B}enter your body!{57}The germs would cause a{57}serious disease!  The disease{62}
{5B}would kill my prince!{5E}
{5B}Put a lid on it, sister!{57}And quit calling him{57}"my prince"!!{62}
{5B}His name is Nigel!{57}He didn't mean to save you!{62}
{5B}It just happened!{57}Do you understand?{62}
{5B}How dare you!{57}I wasn't speaking to you,{57}you pint-sized brat!{5E}
{5B}That's it!!  I've had it{57}with you!  Take that!{57}And that!  And that!{5E}
{5B}Ouch!  Ouch!{5E}
{5B}Stay out of this, Moralis!{57}I can handle this mini-witch{57}by myself!{62}
{5B}Princess!!{57}Mr. Nigel and Miss Friday{57}saved your life!{62}
{5B}...{59}yeah{59}...I'm sorry...{57}but...{59}but...{59}I was so scared!...{62}
{5B}...sob...{57}every day I dropped something{57}down from the tower, but{62}
{5B}nobody came!{57}Nobody noticed a thing!{57}...I was scared!{62}
{5B}...OK, OK...{57}Let's go back home,{57}Princess Lara.{62}
{5B}...Boo, hoo, hoo!...{5E}
{5B}Mr. Nigel!{57}Thank you very much for all{57}of your kindness!{62}
{5B}If you ever come to the{57}continent, please visit Maple!{5E}
{5B}Poor girl...{57}I think she must've cracked{57}being alone in that{62}
{5B}tower for so long...{57}Imagine her calling you{57}"my prince!"  The nerve!{62}
{5B}Anyway...let's go!{57}We have to catch up with{57}Duke Mercator!{5E}
{5B}Run away!  Hurry!{57}She'll change you{57}into a dog!{62}
{5B}Heh heh heh!{57}Too late!{57}You are now....{64}a dog!{5E}
{5B}Hee hee hee...{57}So.  You finally made it!...{62}
{5B}I don't know why, but{57}you seem to be fatal to me.{57}I think you'd better{62}
{5B}DIE now!{57}Hee hee hee...{57}Can't move, can you?  Ha!{5E}
{5B}Ha ha ha!...{57}Your life will come to an end{57}when I press this switch...{62}
{5B}...let's see, now...{57}which switch is it...?{57}Maybe...{64}THIS one!{5E}
{5B}Aauugh!{57}I made a mistake!{5E}
{5B}What a wigged-out witch!{57}Now, let's go!{5E}
{5B}Moooaaann...{57}Grooooaaann...ooooaaannn...{5E}
{5B}Groooaaann...{57}Ohhh, ouch!!{57}Help me...!{62}
{5B}Something is running{57}around in my body!{57}Please help me!{5E}
{5B}Hello!  Me?  Oh, I'm{57}fine, now.  Are my{57}children helpful to you?{5E}
{5B}Wow!  No more pain!{57}Say...that feels good!{62}
{5B}I don't know who you{57}are, but I really want to{57}thank you!{62}
{5B}Listen!  I have many pairs{57}of kids born as twins.{57}Each is connected to a{62}
{5B}corresponding one.  You can{57}teleport from one to the other{57}if you find them both.{62}
{5B}I'll tell my kids{57}to help you.{57}Take care of yourself!{5E}
{5B}Ho, ho...It's me!{57}I came down here to look{57}for something nice, but{62}
{5B}I don't think there's{57}anything here for me...{57}'Bye!{5E}
{5B}Heh heh heh!{57}Here's your money for the{57}{5F}.
Nigel got 2000 golds!
{5B}You're a very good{57}treasure hunter...heh heh heh.
{5B}With that money, you{57}won't have to work for{57}quite some time.  I envy you!
{5B}Wh...what?!
{5B}Help me, please!
{5B}Who are you?
{5B}Hey, you!{57}Hand me that little girl!
{5B}...girl.
{5B}...girl.
{5B}They know I've seen{57}King Nole's treasures!{59}{59}{59}
{5B}They'll do anything to{57}make me talk!
{5B}They'll probably even{57}kill me!  Who knows!{57}So, please...help me!!
{5B}Wait a minute!{57}Did you say{57}"King Nole's treasures?"
{5B}What's with all the{57}jibber-jabber!?  I told you{57}to give me that girl!
{5B}Run!  Hurry!!
{5B}Hmmm...could be{57}interesting!  OK, c'mon!
{5B}Hahahahahaha!{57}You won't get away....
{5B}We did it!{57}She's gone!
{5B}Hey, girl!{57}Did you really see{57}the legendary treasures?
{5B}The name's Friday!{57}Don't call me "girl"!
{5B}OK, ok...and you can{57}call me Nigel.  Now, talk!{57}I saved your life, you know.
{5B}To tell the truth,{57}I didn't really...
{5B}Quit fooling!{59}{59}{59}
{5B}Why were they running{57}after you if you hadn't{57}seen the treasures?
{5B}Well, I didn't actually{57}SEE them, but I know they're{57}around here somewhere...
{5B}Great!{57}Take me to the general{57}area...
{5B}After that, my{57}keen senses will{57}lead us to the treasures.
{5B}All right, then!{57}Follow me, Nigel!
{5B}Let's get one thing{57}straight--I'm not your{57}follower!
{5B}I've got a{57}really bad feeling{57}about all this...
{5B}I hope you're right{57}about those treasures,{57}Friday.{59}{59}{59}
{5B}I paid all my money{57}to that strange big bird!
{5B}But, the ship going{57}to the island only comes{57}once a month!
{5B}You said, "I don't{57}care how much it costs.  I{57}wanna go there right now!"
